MEMASSIN is only in the Developer Mass Maintenance role which is assigned to Firefighter IDs. If this is deemed as needed as an end-user role for the business, please submit a defect that identifies the role this need to be added to and get the appropriate business role owner's approval for the identified role.

Hi Suresh,

 

We were told by Amanda Danielson from ERP IT Purchasing team that we would require this transaction to mass upload PIR info in SAP system.

Given the fact that we would be transitioning from contracts to PIRs this month, we need to do mass uploads via Winshuttle and MEMASSIN.

Let me know if you need any further information.

The originally reported issues. Logon Balancing error is something that the desktop team needs to resolve, as that is a PC issue and not security related.

We've made some initial investigations but we haven't found any concrete evidence to go on to make any specific changes.  I've done a survey and confirmed that signal levels appear to be within tolerance across the plant.  The areas where events are occurring should have more 
than adequate coverage.  In fact, most of these events are reported to have occurred in areas that have direct line-of-sight to installed APs.   So we're currently stuck until we can capture and analyze some detailed debug information from an event or two.

Items of possible note:
The events appear to be more likely to occur in the morning, centered around 9:00AM EST.
The events appear to be more likely to occur when running ZProdStage transactions.
Often the events are preceeded by very slow transaction response times and application hangs.


I've attached an updated copy of incident tracker I've been compiling.

Informed customer: to close a PO, in Me22n- item details- delivery tab user can check the Deliv Completed indicator and (also probably in Invoice Tab should check the Final Invoice indicator),

From GR IR discrepancies standpoint:

4500394301 Invoice receipt not done. Appear to be MR11 GR/IR clearing seem to be done for 1558.50.

Following have invoice showing higher amount. Need to know how THS typically handle case like this:               
4500427659 GR is done for 37,800 LB (127,386.00 USD)  and IR 39,900 LB (132,232.99 USD).  
4500433097 GR is done for 9940 LB (14,231.79 USD) and IR 9940 LB (19,546.81 USD).    

Following 4500427666 and 4500427668 are pretty much same case. GR is done for 42,000 LB (141,540.00 USD) and IR 39,900 LB (139,192.62 USD).  Likely the difference between received and invoice, should be  reverse which is 42,000� 39,900 = 2100 LB

4500485233: GR is done for 330 LB (4,055.01 USD)  Invoice receipt need to be done. 

Also provided the names who have done the GR and the AP person- if they can offer some guidance. Informed user if need to discuss further, kindly to let us know a good time for you and we can have a meeting to discuss (will ask Suresh/Vania to join).

Hi Jerry,

We don't use planned delivery times in SAP. The only categories that use planned delivery times are those that use CoPackers.

Also, we should not be manually changing the SPK in ECC. The source list needs to be maintained via the ZAPO_TLANE upload process in APO.

Hi Melanee,

I changed the Special Procurement Key to B1 for Buckner DC but I believe your group still needs to input the Planned Delivery Time for these three items at Carlisle DC 1609.

Yes, the SPT is correct for 1634 DC. These materials are also setup at 1609 DC, which are the ones I believe need to be updated. 1421 Buckner ships to Buckner DC then to the rest of the Network DCs.

Jerry, can you please review the SPTs at 1609 DC for the materials below? The SPT is BK which is Buckner Plant not Buckner DC.

No problem Jenny, I'm adding Jerry Palarz who master schedules Buckner mayo items. These 3 Mayo items below look to already have BK as the SPK at 1634. So we should be good since sourced from 1421 Buckner plant.

Thanks

Hi Carlos/Melanee,

What needs to be done to get this issue fixed? We have materials that need to get costed but need the SPT to be changed. Does a service desk ticket need to be submitted by one of you?

Good morning all,

I'm still seeing the SPT as BK. The last change in SAP for Material 95T138C1492 at 1630 DC was on 10/19/19. Would there be a reason that would cause the upload that Carlos did yesterday not to update overnight?

Good morning Melanee, Jenny just contacted me on the items listed below as the SPK changes at 1630 to B1 have been changed back again to BK. These items are sourced from 1634 and not 1421.

I just checked the ZAPO_ TLANE (see below) at 1630 for these items and it looks like these need to be corrected or 1630 SPK changes will continuously be overridden. Do you agree? If so, could somebody fix them while Chandra is out?

Jenny needs them complete for costing purposes.

Can you please update the SPT for Material 95T138C1492 at 1630 DC? Currently it's BK which is Buckner Plant. I believe this needs to be updated to B1 Buckner DC.

- MM Work Schdlng prod. Stor. Loc.:  0800 "Non-HU/WM"
- MM WM1 special movement indicator:  1 "Auto 102/WIP"
- Control cycles, supply area RTD-P change from 100/BACKFLUSH to 102/WIP

FG BOMs:
- For WIP material, sort string must contain "B"

FG PrOs:
1. Delete the WIP item on the process order with the 0900 storage location. 
2. Re-add that item to the process order with the  same quantity.  (This should pull the correct storage location "0800" for that material)
3. Add the "B" in the sort string field for this new item.

QA attempted to post the HU to unrestricted stock from the inspection lot change usage decision screen, but received an error message that the material was in in QI stock. Then used HUMO to post the HU back into QI stock, and then posted the HU on the inspection lot usage decision screen to unrestricted stock.

Most likely someone used HUMO to post the HU from QI to unrestricted stock, when the HU should have been posted with the usage decision transaction.

TreeHouse Foods Information Technology`},{prompt:"G0990",response:`Resolution: There is a program with variants and jobs set up to do an auto issue to a cost center for certain materials.

The program is - ZMFGE505_AUTO_GI_CC

The job for plant 1117 is - ZE_MFG_X_E505_1117_CURR_H and runs every hour.

The job has 4 steps calling each of 4 variants that are set up  - 

CUS&1117_CURR            - Issues inventory from a PSA storage types for any materials that have the bulk flag set on them to cost center 11700
CUS&1117_CURR2          - Issues inventory from storage types 100, 134, 135, 140, 145, 146, 147 for materials S10000530308, S10530010060, S10000530206, S05100530022 to CC 11700
CUS&1117_CURR3          - Issues inventory from storage type 148 for material G20600530003 to CC 11700
CUS&1117_CURR4          - Issues inventory from storage type 135, storage bin BAY4 for material G38000462000 to CC 11700

Basically, the first variant exists to issue any materials that are flagged as bulk item (i.e. non-BOM items) from any PSA bin.

The other 3 variants cover some exception items that are really BOM items that are used in the production process in some places, but in other area of the plant the same material is used as a production supply item that we want to issue then the move the inventory to those areas.

So, since G0990 is really a BOM items we would need another exception and could add a new variant - 

CUS&1117_CURR5          - Issues inventory from storage type 134, storage bin BAY84 for material G0990 to CC 11700

And then have Basis team add that step to the job.

We informed the user that We have submitted defect 27198 - MFG - ZMFGE505_AUTO_GI_CC update to add an exception for component G0990 to program ZMFGE505_AUTO_GI_CC. Now we need to wait for MFG Business Architect approval, this may take a couple of days.

Subject: RE: THS SAP issue ORDER 20561234 Ticket= INC0143047

Hi Wesley,
On LX02, if you filter by material S820 in storage location 0800 for that batch (below left) then total the amount on the result screen (below right) there is only 661.716 LB available in the 0800 storage location.  (The system will not allow the 0800 storage location to go negative.)

The issue is that there is -2450 LB of the same material/batch in storage bin TRBT124 � that is off-setting the positive amounts in the other bins.   Can you move some of the positive inventory to the bin with the negative amount so that the system will reflect the true amount in 0800?
Thanks,
Frank`},{prompt:"Orders that need to be PGId in SAP",response:`Resolution: SO # 5518215

Also we reached the Business Experts and the clarified that ZGRPROD won't default the packing material.  That option has been incorporated into the auto GR, but the manual GRPROD doesn't have that. 
When tested some items in ECQ, the pack material was remaining after receiving a pallet for an order.  Also, when switching the process order, the pack material blanked out, so it wouldn't be carrying over PEC from a previous process order if that was a concern. 

They can review a future enhancement for GRPROD to pull in the packing material, but that would be more long-term in timing though.

We also give transaction ZHUCHANGE to the user, to fix the packaging type after the wrong one has been entered, with the link to the step by step THS Training Document.

12/12: As per Donna.

I I met with Anne Sprout and Kelly Carey. What we found was there are several customers that are in channel 5 that need to be moved to the distressed channel 8. There are a few that need to move to Retail channel 001.   What will probably remain in channel 5 are things like prisons and employee sales. We will probably not want to forecast those, so am assuming that once it is cleaned up, we will continue to want to exclude channel 5 from APO. 
Please close the ticket.

Attached is a list of the discrepancies between APO and SLS201 for all categories.  Some of them stopped in March, except X03627T5265, which stopped mid-August.  However, there are many missing materials.

Dolly,

Reported Issue:
Check 10464368 was paid out of ECP on 4/10/19 in the amount of $9510.38

This check needed voiding, however it does not exist in EMP

I need the payment document in EMP in order to have the void properly processed

I processed the void of the check in ECP, I'm sure it is stuck in the AIF as it has nowhere to post to.

Analysis from ASG Team:

I went through the issue and observed the below:

The referenced Invoice paid in EMP by entering invoice manually. Below are the information of the same.

The Invoice already paid in EMP, you might have noticed the same.
Please check the document numbers in EMP in Vendor 409734 Account

1900382577  - Invoice
2000155478  - Payment  Ch No 50001171 and it was cashed.

In ECP:

On 4/10/2019 Payment made through check 10464368 as you mentioned  invoice 14727 dt 7/31/2018

Payment Document # 2000586790 dt 4/10/2019 

This payment was reversed with Document 2000587130  reversal of payment which is stuck in AIF, because there is no prior invoice and payment documents.

Now we need to record the invoice though it was paid in EMP, may be in 66995 vendor, and record a payment documents

then we can refer the two documents in AIF error and can process the reversal document.

It should be done manually, pl let us know who can enter these documents in EMP production system.

If you approve we can use FF user ID and can record these transactions but it is not the practice  we follow, we request business to record the transactions.

We can connect first hour in the morning and can complete this process.

Thanks,

Pete,

I've also talked with Rob Morrow, who tells me Mark Donnelly is helping you with the upgrade. Rob says he might be able to help copy data from the old version to the new version if needed until the new server is in production. Added him to this email.

As it appears MII is doing what is expected (sending data to the system as we know), I would recommend closing this ticket. If/when you want to switch to sending orders to the new system, please let myself or Frank Conrad know the details of the new server, and a time/date when the change should take place.

Tammy may have removed the alerts from one of the tabs under Edit Planning View, but likely did not remove the alerts from the other tab. Alerts for that template are on the 1st and 3rd tabs. Alternatively, instead of removing the alert from the view, she can also select the correct version in the version dropdown on the alerts tab. Attaching picture here. I'm not sure there is anything that needs to be changed on a dev/IT side. Hope this helps.

2) Is it specifically just for the BOL? 
3) WE HAVE A MATERIAL SPECIFIC Organic/GMO material indicator that if checked I believe shows somewhere in the PACKING LIST. This may be sufficient. Not ALL of our materials are ORGANIC are they?

Hi,

We also need to have Customer Service put in block requests through MDG Customer to block the ship-tos in sales org 2000.  That will allow the forecast to show up under 1100.  We need to have these requests put in before the refresh over the weekend.

Bethany � can you work on putting in these requests?  I believe Niki has a list of ship-tos that should be blocked in 2000.

Checking up on this email chain if we got the below info? The PO in this email chain for Wakefern came over to SAP as ED Smith Sales Org 2000 and you can see from their screen shot they wrote it to EDS. 
This order was created yesterday and is shipping after the new year so needs to be updated to BVF as the vendor.  
Joanne or Ed can you please request that?
 
Orders created today for Wakefern did pull 1100 BVF Sales Org.

Jon:
 
Do you have a list of ship-to/material combinations for this change?
 
I checked for example Wakerfern (31006), there are 30 some ship-tos for Wakerfern. But using Katherine's material list in her spreadsheet, maybe only one Wakerfern ship-to (202864) is in scope for this change.

What is the total scope of this issue?
 
At the beginning of this email, it was just speaking about Wakefern.  Now Wegmans is mentioned.
 
Is it that all Wakefern (Cust Hier 31006) and all Wegmans (Cust Hier 31018) items (in all product hierarchies) that were previously CA will now be US?
 
Or, is the change more granular than that?

I can realign the CVCs from CA to US in APO.  We need orders to be processed as US instead of CA, though.  I see open orders coming into APO as CA.

Imran/Maggie,
Can you help with this issue?
There was a sales org re-alignment that happened for Wakefern ship-tos. 
They are not showing up correctly in APO DP. 
 
Eddie,
Can you share specifics around ship-to and SKUs on these?
 
Thanks,

Hello Imran

 

I believe Sid helped load the file to Production - (/ibpreference/prd/work/Warehouse_Manual_File.csv) the last time. For future reference, the excel file you sent has a worksheet named SHERRI2 which is saved as a .csv format (attached ). Once the file has been loaded in Production the existing Master Data Job will process the new file as intended.

 

@Basis can you please help drop the attached csv file in the Production folder path  - /ibpreference/prd/work/

Copying Sai as well, so he is also aware of this process.

 

 

Kind Regards

 

Vivienne
