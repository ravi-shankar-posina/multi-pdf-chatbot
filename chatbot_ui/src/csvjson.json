To this point we've been operating under the assumption that the errors experienced are Signal or Wifi/network infrastructiure related.  For the past week we have had active network debugs running for 2 devices in effort to ascertain the root-cause.  Since ~Oct 10 these devices have not had any reports of disconnects. (WIN 417 and WIN 415 are currently tracked.)\n\nWe've made some initial investigations but we haven't found any concrete evidence to go on to make any specific changes.  I've done a survey and confirmed that signal levels appear to be within tolerance across the plant.  The areas where events are occurring should have more \nthan adequate coverage.  In fact, most of these events are reported to have occurred in areas that have direct line-of-sight to installed APs.   So we're currently stuck until we can capture and analyze some detailed debug information from an event or two.\n\nItems of possible note:\nThe events appear to be more likely to occur in the morning, centered around 9:00AM EST.\nThe events appear to be more likely to occur when running ZProdStage transactions.\nOften the events are preceeded by very slow transaction response times and application hangs.\n\n\nI've attached an updated copy of incident tracker I've been compiling.\nThere is an open service desk incident under INC0121368."

That option has been incorporated into the auto GR, but the manual GRPROD doesn't have that. \nWhen tested some items in ECQ, the pack material was remaining after receiving a pallet for an order.  Also, when switching the process order, the pack material blanked out, so it wouldn't be carrying over PEC from a previous process order if that was a concern. \n\nThey can review a future enhancement for GRPROD to pull in the packing material, but that would be more long-term in timing though.\n\nWe also give transaction ZHUCHANGE to the user, to fix the packaging type after the wrong one has been entered, with the link to the step by step THS Training Document.\nhttp://erphelp.treehousefoods.com/gm/folder-1.11.10585?mode=EU&primaryCSH=ZHUCHANGE%2C\n\nFrom user side they will work on removing the error from their process"
