Somehow the SO's ship to changed to the CID: 10616426 (which is wrong). I couldn't find out how or who changed the CID, but this is wrong and  it will affect the delivery.

RCA/Solution : On the sales order creation date (25.07.2023) there was Ship-to party Customer number 10616426 applied and as per sales order change log there was no change of this info at sales order header level at all. However on 08.01.2024 customer master data for CID 10616426 has been changed. Most probably via auto update data flow from C360 Customer Connect. 
On that day following data has been changed: City, Postal Code, Street.  
In order to fix the issue please update Ship-to CID in all affected sales orders as same as it was already done in SO 728036.
