In summary, this code is primarily focused on appending values to an internal table and preparing to select data from a database based on certain conditions. Each `APPEND` operation adds a new entry to the `r_inact` table, and the `IF` statement checks for a condition before executing a database query.
Here is the provided ABAP code along with a line-by-line explanation in simple English:

```abap
CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT:
prps_status
```
- This line seems to be a label or a comment indicating that the following code relates to the raw OCR (Optical Character Recognition) text for the current page, specifically focusing on the `prps_status` field.

```abap
FROM prps
```
- This line indicates that the data is being selected from the database table named `prps`.

```abap
INTO TABLE gt_prps
```
- This line specifies that the selected data will be stored in an internal table called `gt_prps`.

```abap
WHERE pbukr IN s_bukrs1
```
- This line is part of the selection criteria. It filters the records where the field `pbukr` (which likely represents a company code) matches any of the values in the selection range `s_bukrs1`.

```abap
AND posid IN s_posid1
```
- This line adds another condition to the selection. It filters the records where the field `posid` (which likely represents a position ID) matches any of the values in the selection range `s_posid1`.

```abap
AND aedat IN s_aedat.
```
- This line adds a third condition to the selection. It filters the records where the field `aedat` (which likely represents a date) matches any of the values in the selection range `s_aedat`.

```abap
IF sy-subrc EQ 0.
```
- This line checks if the previous SELECT statement was successful. `sy-subrc` is a system variable that indicates the return code of the last operation. If it equals 0, it means records were found.

```abap
SORT gt_prps BY pspnr posid.

CURRENT_PAGE_HTML:
```
- This line seems to be another label or comment indicating that the following code relates to the HTML representation of the current page.

Overall, this ABAP code is designed to select specific fields from the `prps` table based on certain criteria, handle the case where no records are found, and prepare for further processing or display of the data.
Here is the provided ABAP code with explanations for each line:

```abap
CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT:
INTO TABLE gt_prps
```
- This line indicates that data is being selected from a source (not shown in the snippet) and is being stored into an internal table called `gt_prps`.

```abap
WHERE pbukr IN s_bukrs
```
- This line specifies a condition for the selection: it filters the records where the field `pbukr` (which likely represents a company code or similar identifier) matches any of the values in the selection range `s_bukrs`.

```abap
AND posid IN s_posid
```
- This line adds another condition to the selection: it filters the records where the field `posid` (which could represent a position ID) matches any of the values in the selection range `s_posid`.

```abap
AND erdat IN s_erdat.
```
- This line adds a third condition to the selection: it filters the records where the field `erdat` (which likely represents the date of creation) matches any of the values in the selection range `s_erdat`.

```abap
IF sy-subrc EQ 0.
```
- This line checks if the previous operation (the data selection) was successful. `sy-subrc` is a system variable that holds the return code of the last operation; a value of `0` indicates success.

```abap
SORT gt_prps BY pspnr posid.
```
- If the selection was successful, this line sorts the internal table `gt_prps` by the fields `pspnr` (possibly a project number) and `posid`.

```abap
IF p_inact = space.
```
- This line checks if the variable `p_inact` is empty (or not set). If it is empty, the following block of code will execute.

```abap
DELETE gt_prps WHERE prps_status IN r_inact.
```
- This line deletes entries from the internal table `gt_prps` where the field `prps_status` matches any of the values in the range `r_inact`.

```abap
ENDIF.
```
- This line marks the end of the `IF` block that checks if `p_inact` is empty.

```abap
ELSE.
```
- This line indicates the start of the alternative block that executes if the previous `IF` condition (checking `sy-subrc`) was not met (i.e., the selection was unsuccessful).

```abap
MESSAGE s001(zcora) WITH text-008 DISPLAY LIKE c_e.
```
- This line triggers a message to be displayed to the user. The message is defined in the message class `zcora` with the number `s001`, and it includes the text from `text-008`. The `DISPLAY LIKE c_e` part specifies how the message should be displayed (likely as an error).

```abap
LEAVE LIST-PROCESSING.
```
- This line exits the current list processing, which means it stops any further processing of the list that was being generated.

```abap
ENDIF.
```
- This line marks the end of the `IF` block that checks the success of the data selection.

```abap
ENDIF.
```
- This line marks the end of the outer `IF` block that checks if the selection was successful.

```abap
ENDFORM.                         " DATA_SELECTION
```
- This line indicates the end of the form routine named `DATA_SELECTION`.

```abap

```
- This line begins the definition of the form routine `populate_output_data`.

```abap
LOOP AT gt_prps INTO DATA(gs_prps).
```
- This line starts a loop that iterates over each entry in the internal table `gt_prps`, storing the current entry in a variable `gs_prps`.

```abap
CONCATENATE sy-datum sy-uzeit INTO gs_final-batchid." SEPARATED
BY c_hig.
```
- This line concatenates the current date (`sy-datum`) and time (`sy-uzeit`) into a single string and stores it in the field `gs_final-batchid`. The comment suggests that the concatenation is separated by a constant `c_hig`, although the actual separation is not shown in this line.

```abap
CURRENT_PAGE_HTML:
```
- This line seems to indicate the start of a new section or block of code related to `CURRENT_PAGE_HTML`, but the actual code is not provided in the snippet.

Overall, this code is part of an ABAP program that selects data based on certain criteria, processes that data, and prepares it for output. The use of internal tables, conditional statements, and loops is common in ABAP for handling data operations.
Here is the ABAP code you provided, along with a line-by-line explanation in simple English:

```abap
CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT:
gs_final-sysid = c_power.
```
- This line assigns the value of `c_power` to the field `sysid` in the structure `gs_final`. This is likely setting a system identifier.

```abap
CALL FUNCTION 'CONVERSION_EXIT_ABPSN_OUTPUT'
```
- This line calls a function module named `CONVERSION_EXIT_ABPSN_OUTPUT`. Function modules are reusable pieces of code in ABAP.

```abap
EXPORTING
input = gs_prps-posid
```
- Here, the code is exporting a variable named `input`, which is set to the value of `posid` from the structure `gs_prps`. This means the function will use this value for processing.

```abap
IMPORTING
output = gs_prps-posid.
```
- This line imports the result of the function back into the `posid` field of the `gs_prps` structure. The function processes the input and returns an output.

```abap
CONCATENATE c_power gs_prps-pkokr gs_prps-pbukr gs_prps-posid
INTO gs_final-unkey
SEPARATED BY c_hig.
```
- This line concatenates (joins together) the values of `c_power`, `pkokr`, `pbukr`, and `posid` from `gs_prps`, and stores the result in `gs_final-unkey`. The values are separated by `c_hig`, which is likely a defined separator.

```abap
CONCATENATE c_power gs_prps-pbukr INTO gs_final-bukrs SEPARATED
BY c_hig.
```
- Similar to the previous line, this concatenates `c_power` and `pbukr` from `gs_prps`, and stores the result in `gs_final-bukrs`, again using `c_hig` as a separator.

```abap
gs_final-posid     = gs_prps-posid.
```
- This line directly assigns the value of `posid` from `gs_prps` to `posid` in `gs_final`. It is copying the value.

```abap
CALL FUNCTION 'CONVERSION_EXIT_ABPSN_OUTPUT'
```
- This line calls the same function module `CONVERSION_EXIT_ABPSN_OUTPUT` again.

```abap
EXPORTING
input = gs_final-posid
```
- The input for this function call is now the `posid` from `gs_final`. It will process this value.

```abap
IMPORTING
output = gs_final-posid.
```
- The output from the function is imported back into `gs_final-posid`, updating it with the processed value.

```abap
gs_final-ltext    = gs_prps-post1.
```
- This line assigns the value of `post1` from `gs_prps` to `ltext` in `gs_final`. It is copying another value.

```abap
CALL FUNCTION 'SCP_REPLACE_STRANGE_CHARS'
```
- This line calls another function module named `SCP_REPLACE_STRANGE_CHARS`, which likely replaces unusual characters in a string.

```abap
EXPORTING
intext = gs_final-ltext
```
- The input for this function is the `ltext` from `gs_final`, which will be processed to remove or replace strange characters.

```abap
IMPORTING
outtext = gs_final-ltext.
```
- The output from the function, which is the processed text, is imported back into `gs_final-ltext`, updating it with the cleaned-up version.

```abap
CURRENT_PAGE_HTML:
```
- This line seems to indicate the start of another section or block of code related to `CURRENT_PAGE_HTML`, but no further code is provided here.

Overall, this code processes some identifiers and text, ensuring they are formatted correctly and free of strange characters, and stores the results in a final structure for further use.
Here is the provided ABAP code with explanations for each line:

```abap
CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT:
IF gs_prps-prps_status IN r_inact.
```
- This line defines a label `CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT` for a section of code. It checks if the `prps_status` field of the structure `gs_prps` is included in the internal table `r_inact`.

```abap
gs_final-aflag = c_false.
```
- If the condition above is true (meaning the status is inactive), this line sets the `aflag` field of the structure `gs_final` to `c_false`, indicating a false condition.

```abap
ELSEIF gs_prps-prps_status IN r_act.
```
- This line checks another condition. If the `prps_status` is not in `r_inact`, it checks if it is in the internal table `r_act` (which presumably contains active statuses).

```abap
gs_final-aflag = c_true.
```
- If the second condition is true (meaning the status is active), this line sets the `aflag` field of `gs_final` to `c_true`, indicating a true condition.

```abap
ENDIF.
```
- This line marks the end of the conditional statements (IF...ELSEIF...ENDIF).

```abap
APPEND gs_final TO gt_final.
```
- This line appends the contents of the structure `gs_final` to the internal table `gt_final`, effectively adding the processed data to a collection.

```

### Summary of the Code:
- The code initializes several variables for handling screen text, strings, and date.
- It creates instances of grid and label objects for displaying data.
- The current date is formatted and stored in a variable.
- The number of lines in an output table is counted.
- Two strings are concatenated with specific text and values.
- An ALV (ABAP List Viewer) table is created if it is not already bound, and the output table is passed to it.
- The ALV table is refreshed, and its columns are optimized for better display.
Here is the provided ABAP code along with a line-by-line explanation in simple English:

```abap
CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT:
lr_tabledescr_ref ?= cl_abap_typedescr=>describe_by_data( pt_output ).
```
- This line is defining a variable `CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT`. It assigns a reference to a table description object (`lr_tabledescr_ref`) by calling a method `describe_by_data` from the class `cl_abap_typedescr`. This method takes `pt_output` as input, which is likely a data structure containing the output data.

```abap
