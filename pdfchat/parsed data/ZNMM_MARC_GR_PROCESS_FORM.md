The provided ABAP code contains two forms: `GET_HARDCODE_VALUES` and `GET_FILE_DATA`. Below is a summary of each form and suggestions for improving performance, particularly for the `GET_HARDCODE_VALUES` form as requested.

### Form: GET_HARDCODE_VALUES
- **Purpose**: This form retrieves hardcoded values from a custom function module `Z_UHARD_CODE_VALUE` and populates two global structures (`GR_LFART_IBD` and `GR_LFART_OBD`) based on specific conditions.
- **Key Operations**:
- Clears and initializes internal tables and structures.
- Calls a function module to fetch data into `GT_ZTUHCD1`.
- Sorts the data if it is successfully retrieved.
- Loops through the data to filter and append values to `GR_LFART_IBD` and `GR_LFART_OBD`.

### Performance Improvement Suggestions:
1. **Avoid Multiple Loops**: Instead of looping through `GT_ZTUHCD1` twice for different conditions, consider using a single loop and a conditional statement to handle both cases. This reduces the number of iterations over the same data.

```abap
LOOP AT GT_ZTUHCD1 INTO GI_ZTUHCD1.
IF GI_ZTUHCD1-ZKEY = 'IBD' AND GI_ZTUHCD1-FIELD = 'LFART'.
GR_LFART_IBD-SIGN = 'I'.
GR_LFART_IBD-OPTION = 'EQ'.
GR_LFART_IBD-LOW = GI_ZTUHCD1-LOW.
APPEND GR_LFART_IBD TO GR_LFART_IBD.
ELSEIF GI_ZTUHCD1-ZKEY = 'OBD' AND GI_ZTUHCD1-FIELD = 'LFART'.
GR_LFART_OBD-SIGN = 'I'.
GR_LFART_OBD-OPTION = 'EQ'.
GR_LFART_OBD-LOW = GI_ZTUHCD1-LOW.
APPEND GR_LFART_OBD TO GR_LFART_OBD.
ENDIF.
ENDLOOP.
```

2. **Use of `SORT`**: If the sorting of `GT_ZTUHCD1` is not necessary for the subsequent processing, consider removing it to save processing time.

3. **Directly Append to Structures**: If `GR_LFART_IBD` and `GR_LFART_OBD` are defined as internal tables, ensure they are declared as such and use `APPEND` efficiently. If they are single entries, consider using direct assignment instead of appending.

### Form: GET_FILE_DATA
- **Purpose**: This form retrieves data from the `ztmm_marc_gr_h` table based on certain conditions.
- **Key Operations**:
- It checks if `p_delta` is not initial and performs a conditional select from the database.

### Performance Improvement Suggestions:
1. **Use of `SELECT SINGLE`**: If you only need a single record based on the conditions, consider using `SELECT SINGLE` instead of `SELECT *`, which retrieves all fields and can be more resource-intensive.

2. **Indexing**: Ensure that the fields used in the `WHERE` clause (`comp_code`, `tran_seq_no`, `rech_seq`) are indexed in the database to improve the performance of the select statement.

3. **Avoiding `IN` Clause**: If `s_tran` and `s_poseq` are large, consider alternative methods to filter data, such as using joins or subqueries, which might be more efficient depending on the data volume.

By implementing these suggestions, the performance of the reprocessing program can be improved significantly.

### Key Components of the Code:

1. **Conditional Logic**:
- The code uses `IF` statements to check if certain fields (like `DELIV_ITEM`) are initialized. Based on these checks, it assigns values to various fields in the `GI_MARC_GR_ITEM` structure and the `<GFS_RECL>` structure.

2. **Field Assignments**:
- The code assigns values from the `GI_BAPI_GM_ITEM` and `GI_BAPI_GM_HEAD` structures to the `GI_MARC_GR_ITEM` structure. This includes fields like `BAPI_PO_NO`, `BAPI_PO_LINE_NO`, `SKU`, `QTY_EXPE`, and others.

3. **Appending Data**:
- After populating the `GI_MARC_GR_ITEM` structure, it appends this item to an internal table `GT_MARC_GR_ITEM` and then clears the `GI_MARC_GR_ITEM` structure for the next iteration.

4. **Form Routine**:
- The code is part of a form routine named `FILL_BAPI`, which takes a parameter `PW_VENDOR`. This suggests that the routine is designed to fill in data related to a vendor.

5. **Date and Time**:

- Various local variables (`LW_VENDOR1`, `LW_SUP_VENDOR`, `LW_REF_DOC_NO`, etc.) are declared with specific types, including custom types like `ZALTMN`.
- `LW_PLANT` is declared to hold plant information.

2. **Data Assignment**:
- The code assigns values from the `<GFS_RECL>` structure to local variables and global tables (e.g., `GW_PO_NO_TAB`, `GW_SKU_TAB`, etc.).

3. **Material Conversion and Validation**:
- The variable `LV_ZZALTMN` is assigned the SKU from `<GFS_RECL>`.
- A read operation is performed on an internal table `GT_ZTUHCD1` to fetch the plant information based on certain keys.

4. **BAPI Call**:
- A function module `ZMM_MARC_ALT_MAT_CONV_FM` is called to convert material numbers. It takes the material number, plant, and material type as input and returns various outputs, including the material number and a flag indicating if the conversion was successful.

5. **Conditional Logic**:
- After the BAPI call, there are checks to determine if the conversion was successful (`GW_FLAG`), if the alternative material number (`GW_ZZALTMN`) is not initial, and if its length is within a specified limit.
- If the conditions are not met, an error handling mechanism is triggered, setting error flags and messages.

6. **Comments**:
- The code includes comments indicating changes made by a specific user on a specific date, which is useful for tracking modifications.

This ABAP code is designed to validate and process vendor-related data, perform material number conversions, and handle errors appropriately. It utilizes function modules for specific operations and includes checks to ensure data integrity before proceeding with further processing.
The provided ABAP code snippet appears to handle error processing for records in a data processing routine. Here’s a breakdown of the key components and logic:

1. **Concatenation and Status Update**:
- The code concatenates a rejection reason with a SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) and updates the process status to 'M' (likely indicating a "manual" or "error" status).
- It assigns the concatenated rejection reason to a field in the `<GFS_RECL>` structure.

2. **Conditional Logic**:
- If the parameter `P_REPR` is set to 'X', it updates the `CHANGED_DATE`, `CHANGED_TIME`, and `CHANGED_BY` fields with the current date, time, and user name, respectively.

3. **File Table Update**:
- The `PERFORM FILE_TABLE_UPDATE` statement is called to presumably log or update the error in a file or table.

4. **Error Handling**:
- If a record has non-numeric values in the `PO_LINE_NO`, it triggers an error handling routine. The `NUMERIC_CHECK` function is used to validate the `GW_VALUE`.
- If the value is not numeric, it sets error flags and updates the rejection reason accordingly.

5. **Return Logic**:
- The variable `GV_CONTINUE` is set to 'X', and the routine returns, indicating that further processing of the current record should stop.

6. **Error Reporting**:
- The error reporting mechanism uses various global variables (e.g., `GW_REC_ERROR`, `GW_INPUT_STATUS_TAB`, `GW_ERROR_TYPE_TAB`, `GW_REJECT_REASON_TAB`) to capture and report the error details.

Overall, the code is structured to validate input data, handle errors, and maintain a record of changes and issues encountered during processing.
The provided ABAP code snippet appears to be part of a larger program that processes records, specifically focusing on validating quantities and units of measure (UOM). Here’s a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Quantity Validation**:
- The code checks if the quantity (`QTY_EXPE`) contains non-numeric values using the `NUMERIC_CHECK` function.
- If the quantity is non-numeric, it sets error flags and updates the record with a rejection reason, including the problematic value.

2. **Unit of Measure Validation**:
- The code retrieves the unit of measure abbreviation (`UOM_ABBREV`) from the record and attempts to read a corresponding entry from the internal table `GT_ZTUHCD1`.
- If the UOM is not found, it similarly sets error flags and updates the record with a rejection reason.

3. **Error Handling**:
- In both cases of validation failure (quantity and UOM), the code updates the process status to 'M' (indicating a problem) and records the reason for rejection.
- If a specific parameter (`P_REPR`) is set to 'X', it also updates the record with the current date, time, and user name.

4. **File Table Update**:
- After processing each record, whether it passes validation or not, the code calls a subroutine (`PERFORM FILE_TABLE_UPDATE`) to update a file table with the current record's information.

5. **Control Flow**:

- If the plant is found (`SY-SUBRC = 0`), it assigns the plant value to `GI_BAPI_GM_ITEM-PLANT`.
- If not found, it sets error flags and updates the error report with a rejection reason.

2. **Error Handling**:
- If the plant is not found, it populates various error-related fields (`GW_REC_ERROR`, `GW_INPUT_STATUS_TAB`, etc.) and updates the record with the current date, time, and user if a specific parameter (`P_REPR`) is set.
- The `PERFORM FILE_TABLE_UPDATE` is called to handle the error record.

3. **Batch Number Processing**:
- The code checks if both the plant and material are initialized.
- It retrieves the `XCHPF` field from the `MARC` table to determine if the material is batch-managed.
- If the material is batch-managed and the lot number (`GW_LOT`) is checked against 'NO-LOT', it processes the record similarly to the plant validation, setting error flags and updating the error report.

4. **Continuation Logic**:
- The variable `GV_CONTINUE` is set to 'X' to indicate that processing should continue, and the function returns early in case of errors.

This code is structured to ensure that any issues with plant or batch data are captured and reported, allowing for further processing or correction as needed. If you have specific questions about parts of the code or need further clarification, feel free to ask!

The provided ABAP code snippet appears to be part of a larger program that handles the calculation of open quantities and the processing of goods receipt (GR) items, particularly in the context of customer returns and delta runs.

### Key Components of the Code:

1. **Open Quantity Calculation**:
- The code checks if the parameter `P_REPR` is set to 'X'. If so, it sets `GW_FAIL_STEP` to '30' and checks the process status and fail step before calling the `CALC_OPEN_QTY` subroutine.
- If `P_REPR` is not 'X', it directly calls `CALC_OPEN_QTY`.

2. **Post BAPI Execution**:
- After calculating the open quantity, if `P_REPR` is 'X', it checks the process status and fail step again to determine if it should call `POST_BAPI` (which handles both step 30 and 40).
- It then sets `GW_FAIL_STEP` to '40' and checks if the process status and fail step match to call `POST_BAPI_SH` (which handles step 40).
- If `P_REPR` is not 'X', it simply calls `POST_BAPI`.

3. **Form GR_04**:
- This form handles the processing of goods receipt items, particularly in a delta run scenario.
- It initializes several local variables and field symbols, and sets a flag `GW_CUST_RET` to 'X' to indicate a customer returns scenario.

- Finally, `FILE_TABLE_UPDATE` is called to update the file table with the new material document number and items.

This code is structured to ensure that goods movements are processed correctly, with checks and balances in place for data integrity and error handling.
The provided ABAP code snippet is part of a process that handles error reprocessing in SAP. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Looping through Items**: The code loops through a table `GT_BAPI_GM_ITEM` to read corresponding entries from `GT_MARC_GR_ITEM` based on specific keys (`BAPI_ITEM_TEXT` and `BAPI_UNLOAD_PT`). If a match is found (`SY-SUBRC = 0`), it moves the corresponding item to `LI_MARC_GR_ITEM` and appends it to `LT_MARC_GR_ITEM`.

2. **Error Handling**: After processing, it checks for errors by reading from `GT_BAPI_RETURN`. If an error of type 'E' is found, it concatenates the error ID and number into `GW_BAPI_ERROR` and checks if it exists in `S_RETURN`.

3. **Fetching Error Details**: If the error is found, it calls the function `BAPI_MESSAGE_GETDETAIL` to retrieve detailed error messages, which are then stored in various variables for further processing.

4. **Updating Status**: The code updates several status variables and calls various subroutines (`RECL_UPDATE`, `ERROR_TABLE_UPDATE`, `FILE_TABLE_UPDATE`) to log the error status, fail step, and error message.

5. **Handling Non-Overage Cases**: If the process is not an overage case, it handles the error accordingly, ensuring that the error details are captured and logged.

This code is structured to ensure that any errors encountered during the processing of items are properly handled and logged, allowing for easier troubleshooting and resolution.
The provided ABAP code snippet appears to be part of a larger program that handles the processing of goods movements in SAP. Here’s a breakdown of the key components and their functionalities:

1. **Error Handling**:
- The code sets various error-related variables (`GW_INPUT_STATUS_TAB`, `GW_ERROR_TYPE_TAB`, etc.) when an error occurs during processing.
- It updates the RECH and RECL tables with the error status, fail step, and error message using the `PERFORM` statement.

2. **Clearing Variables**:
- After processing, several variables are cleared to reset their values for the next operation.

3. **Conditional Logic**:
- The code checks if the `GT_BAPI_GM_ITEM` table is empty and if `GT_BAPI_GM_ITEM_SH` is not empty, indicating a specific condition for processing.

4. **Vendor Number Conversion**:
- For each item in `GT_BAPI_GM_ITEM_SH`, if the vendor number is not initial, it calls a conversion function to ensure the vendor number is in the correct format.

5. **Test Run and BAPI Call**:
- A test run is performed using the `PERFORM TEST_RUN_BAPI` statement, which likely simulates the goods movement without committing it.
- If there are items in `GT_BAPI_GM_ITEM_SH`, it calls the `BAPI_GOODSMVT_CREATE` function to create a goods movement document.

6. **Transaction Commit**:
- If the goods movement document number (`GW_MBLNR_SH`) is generated, it commits the transaction using `BAPI_TRANSACTION_COMMIT`.

7. **Final Status Update**:
- The status is updated to 'C' (presumably indicating completion), and relevant variables are cleared again.

This code is structured to handle both error scenarios and successful processing of goods movements, ensuring that the system maintains data integrity and provides feedback on the processing status.
The provided ABAP code snippet appears to be part of a larger program that handles the processing of goods movement items, specifically focusing on error handling and updating related tables based on the results of a BAPI (Business Application Programming Interface) call.

### Key Components of the Code:

1. **Error Handling**:
- The code checks for errors in the `GT_BAPI_RETURN_SH` table, which likely contains messages returned from a BAPI call.
- If an error is found (indicated by `TYPE = 'E'`), it retrieves detailed error messages using the `BAPI_MESSAGE_GETDETAIL` function.

2. **Updating Tables**:
- The code updates various tables based on the processing results:
- `LT_MARC_GR_ITEM` is populated with entries from `GT_BAPI_GM_ITEM_SH` if they match certain criteria.
- Error statuses and messages are recorded in the `RECH` and `RECL` tables through the `RECL_UPDATE` subroutine.

3. **Conditional Logic**:
- The code uses conditional statements to determine the flow of processing based on whether errors are present or if the processing is successful.

4. **Data Movement**:
- The `MOVE-CORRESPONDING` statement is used to transfer data from one structure to another, ensuring that fields with the same name are copied.

5. **Looping Through Items**:
- A loop iterates over `GT_BAPI_GM_ITEM_SH`, checking for corresponding entries in `GT_MARC_GR_ITEM` and appending them to `LT_MARC_GR_ITEM`.

### Summary:
This ABAP code is designed to handle the processing of goods movement items, focusing on error detection and handling, updating relevant tables with error information, and ensuring that successful entries are recorded appropriately. The use of BAPI calls and detailed error messaging indicates a robust approach to managing data integrity and user feedback in the SAP environment.
The provided ABAP code snippet appears to be part of a larger program that handles error processing and updates related to a specific business process. Here’s a breakdown of the key components and their functions:

1. **Error Handling and Status Updates**:
- The code updates various global variables and tables with error messages and statuses. For example, `GW_MESSAGE_SH` is used to store messages related to errors, and `GW_INPUT_STATUS_TAB` is set to 'E' to indicate an error status.
- The `PERFORM` statements are used to call subroutines (`RECL_UPDATE`, `ERROR_TABLE_UPDATE`, and `FILE_TABLE_UPDATE`) that likely handle the logic for updating records in the RECH and RECL tables with the error status, fail step, and error message.

2. **Clearing and Refreshing Variables**:
- The `CLEAR` statement is used to reset several global variables to their initial state, ensuring that no residual data affects subsequent processing.
- The `REFRESH` statement clears the contents of internal tables like `GT_BAPI_GM_ITEM`, `GT_BAPI_RETURN`, etc.

3. **Error Reprocessing Logic**:
- The `ERROR_REPROCESS` form is designed to handle reprocessing of records that have encountered errors. It loops through the `GT_GR_RECH_MAIN` table to find records with a process status of 'E' (indicating an error).
- If an error record is found, it appends it to the `GT_GR_RECH` table and then looks for related records in `GT_GR_RECL_MAIN` that match specific criteria (like `FILE_NAME`, `COMP_CODE`, etc.) and also have a process status of 'E'.

4. **Conditional Logic**:
- The code includes conditional checks (e.g., `IF GI_GR_RECH-PROCESS_STATUS = 'E'`) to ensure that only records with the appropriate status are processed.

5. **Comments and Change History**:
- The code contains comments indicating changes made by a specific user (USPRADI JE3K906283) on a specific date, which is useful for tracking modifications and understanding the evolution of the code.

Overall, this ABAP code is focused on managing error states in a business process, ensuring that errors are logged, and providing a mechanism for reprocessing records that have failed.
The provided ABAP code snippets include several forms and logic for processing records, handling messages, and refreshing data tables. Here’s a brief overview of the key components:

1. **Error Handling Logic**:
- The code checks if any error records are found for transaction sequence numbers. If no errors are found (`GV_FOUND IS INITIAL`), it displays a message and exits the list processing.

2. **FILL_AUTOMSGS Form**:
- This form populates a message ID table (`S_MSGID`) with messages that have an auto reprocess flag (`GI_MARC_MSG_PR-PROCESSING = 'AU'`). It only processes records if no specific message ID is provided.

3. **REFRESH Form**:
- This form refreshes multiple internal tables, clearing their contents. It includes a long list of tables that are likely used throughout the program for various data processing tasks.
