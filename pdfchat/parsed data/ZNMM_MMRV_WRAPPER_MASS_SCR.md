The provided ABAP code snippet defines a selection screen with two blocks. Here's a breakdown of the components:

1. **Blocks**:
- The code starts with the definition of two blocks (`b2` and `b3`) using `SELECTION-SCREEN: BEGIN OF BLOCK`. Each block has a title defined by `text-t02` and `text-t03`.

2. **Select-Options**:
- `SELECT-OPTIONS : s_bukrs FOR t001-bukrs NO INTERVALS OBLIGATORY MEMORY ID buk.`
- This line creates a selection option for the company code (`bukrs`) from the table `t001`. It is marked as obligatory, meaning the user must provide a value, and it uses a memory ID (`buk`) for storing the selection.

3. **Parameter**:
- `PARAMETER : p_1 AS CHECKBOX DEFAULT 'X'.`
- This line defines a checkbox parameter (`p_1`) that defaults to 'X' (checked).

4. **End of Blocks**:
- The blocks are closed with `SELECTION-SCREEN: END OF BLOCK`.

This code is typically used in an ABAP report to allow users to input selection criteria before executing the report logic.
