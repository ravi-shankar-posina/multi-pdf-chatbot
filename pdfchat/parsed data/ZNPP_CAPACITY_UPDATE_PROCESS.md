The provided ABAP code snippet is a form routine named `GET_DATA`, which retrieves data related to materials and their movements from the database tables `MARC` and `MSEG`. Here’s a breakdown of the key components of the code:

1. **Material Selection**:
- The code selects material numbers (`matnr`), plant (`werks`), and other relevant fields from the `MARC` table based on the selection criteria provided in the selection screen (variables `s_plant` and `s_mrp`).
- The results are stored in an internal table `gt_marc`, and if records are found (`sy-subrc EQ 0`), the table is sorted by `matnr`, `werks`, and `dispo`.

2. **Date Range Preparation**:
- A date range is prepared for the selection of movement records. If the lower limit of the date range (`s_date-low`) is not provided, it defaults to 90 days before the current date (`sy-datum`).

3. **Movement Type Range**:
- A range for movement types is defined to include types '101' and '102', which are typically used for goods movements in SAP.

4. **Capacity Records Retrieval**:
- If the `gt_marc` table is not empty, the code retrieves records from the `MSEG` table for all materials listed in `gt_marc`. It filters the records based on the movement types defined earlier, the plant, and the posting date range.
- The results are stored in the internal table `gt_mseg`, and if records are found, they are sorted by `matnr`, `werks`, and `bwart`.

5. **Calendar ID Selection**:
- Finally, the code selects the factory calendar (`fabkl`) for the specified plants from the `T001W` table, storing the results in the internal table `gt_fid`.

This routine is likely part of a larger program that processes material capacity updates, and it includes comments indicating the purpose of each section and the changes made for specific requirements.
The provided ABAP code snippets include various operations such as sorting, looping through internal tables, calling functions, and performing database selections. Here’s a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Sorting and Looping**:
- The first snippet checks if a certain condition (`sy-subrc EQ 0`) is met, and if so, it sorts the internal table `gt_fid` by the field `werks`.
- It then loops through the `gt_fid` table, calling a function to select working days for a given period and populating the `gt_days` table with the results.

2. **Error Handling**:
- After calling the function `RKE_SELECT_FACTDAYS_FOR_PERIOD`, there is a check for `sy-subrc` to handle any errors that may occur during the function call.

3. **Fetching Data**:
- The second snippet fetches percentages from the `ZTPP_CAPACITY` table based on certain selection criteria (`s_plant` and `s_mrp`). If the selection is successful, it sorts the resulting `gt_capacity` table.

4. **Final Data Compilation**:
- The `final_data` form sums records from `gt_mseg` into `gt_mlist`. It reads from `gt_marc` using a binary search and collects the results into `gt_mlist`.

5. **General Structure**:
- The code is structured with clear comments indicating the purpose of each section, including changes made for specific change requests (e.g., CHG1178311).

The provided ABAP code snippet appears to be part of a larger program that processes data related to inventory or capacity management. Here’s a breakdown of the key components and functionality:

1. **Data Initialization and Looping**:
- The code begins by clearing several internal tables (`gi_mlist`, `gi_marc`, `gi_mseg`) and then sorts the `gt_mlist` table by specific fields (`dispo`, `bwart`, `werks`).
- It initializes a variable `lw_val5` of type integer.

2. **Capacity Calculation**:
- The main logic is contained within a loop that iterates over `gt_mlist`.
- Depending on the value of `bwart`, it either subtracts or adds the `menge` (quantity) to `lw_capacity`.
- It captures the plant and disposal information into `gi_final`.

3. **Reading and Calculating Capacity**:
- At the end of each `dispo` group, it reads from `gt_days` to determine the number of days and calculates `lw_cap1` based on the capacity divided by the number of days, handling cases where `days` is not initialized.
- It also reads from `gt_capacity` to get the percentage for the current plant and disposal.

4. **Finalizing Data**:
- The calculated values are rounded up using `ceil` and assigned to `gi_final`.
- Metadata such as the user who created the entry and the timestamp is also captured.
- The `gi_final` structure is modified in the `ztpp_capacity` table and appended to `gt_final`.

5. **Display Logic**:
- The `display_data` form is set up to handle the display of the final data using the SALV (Simple ALV) classes, which are used for displaying data in a user-friendly format.

### Key Points:
- The code is designed to manage and calculate inventory or capacity based on certain business rules (e.g., handling different `bwart` values).
- It includes error handling and checks for initial values to avoid division by zero.
- The use of SALV classes indicates that the output will be presented in a structured format, likely in an ALV grid.

The provided ABAP code snippet is part of a form routine named `DISPLAY_DATA`. It utilizes the SALV (Simple ALV) framework to create and display an ALV (ABAP List Viewer) table. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Creating the ALV Table**:
- The `cl_salv_table=>factory` method is called to create an ALV table object (`gt_alv`) based on the internal table `gt_final`.

2. **Error Handling**:
- A `CATCH` block is used to handle exceptions of type `cx_salv_msg` that may occur during the creation of the ALV table.

3. **Column Management**:
- The columns of the ALV table are retrieved using `get_columns()`.
- Specific columns (`MANDT`, `PERCENTAGE`, and `QUANTITY`) are accessed using `get_column()`. If a column is not found, it is caught by the `CATCH cx_salv_not_found` block.

4. **Column Visibility and Properties**:
- The visibility of the `MANDT` and `PERCENTAGE` columns is set to false, effectively hiding them from the display.
- The `QUANTITY` column is configured with long text, medium text, and output length properties.

5. **Displaying the ALV**:
- The `display()` method is called on the ALV object to render the table.
- If no data is found in `gt_final`, a message is displayed indicating that no data is available.

6. **Message Handling**:
- A message of type 'I' (information) is displayed if the internal table `gt_final` is empty.

This code is structured to ensure that the ALV is displayed correctly with the desired columns and properties, while also handling potential errors gracefully.
