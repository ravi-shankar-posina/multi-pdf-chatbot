```abap
SORT gt_ekbe BY ebeln
belnr DESCENDING
lfbnr.
```
9. **SORT gt_ekbe BY ebeln belnr DESCENDING lfbnr.** - This line sorts the `gt_ekbe` table by `ebeln`, then by `belnr` in descending order, and finally by `lfbnr`. This means that for the same `ebeln`, the entries will be ordered from highest to lowest `belnr`.

```abap
***End of change by Ratna on 21.10.2022
ENDIF.
```
10. **ENDIF.** - This marks the end of the IF statement that checks for the success of the SELECT operation.

```abap
SELECT ebeln
bukrs
FROM ekko
INTO TABLE gt_ekko
FOR ALL ENTRIES IN gt_essr
