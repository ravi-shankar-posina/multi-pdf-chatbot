Certainly! Below is the provided ABAP code along with a line-by-line explanation in simple English.

```abap
CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT:
* Selection Screen for run options

SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF BLOCK b2 WITH FRAME TITLE text-002.
```
- **CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT:** This is likely a label or identifier for a section of code related to raw OCR (Optical Character Recognition) text processing.
- **\* Selection Screen for run options:** This is a comment that describes the purpose of the following code block, indicating that it is for a selection screen where users can choose options for running a program.
- **SELECTION-SCREEN BEGIN OF BLOCK b2 WITH FRAME TITLE text-002.:** This line starts a new block on the selection screen. The block is labeled "b2" and has a frame with a title that is defined by the text element `text-002`. This title will be displayed at the top of the block.

```abap
PARAMETERS: p_test RADIOBUTTON GROUP gr DEFAULT 'X',
```
- **PARAMETERS:** This keyword is used to define input fields on the selection screen.
- **p_test RADIOBUTTON GROUP gr DEFAULT 'X',** This line defines a radio button named `p_test`. It belongs to a group called `gr`, which means that only one radio button in this group can be selected at a time. The `DEFAULT 'X'` part means that this radio button will be selected by default when the selection screen is displayed.

```abap
p_prod RADIOBUTTON GROUP gr.
```
- **p_prod RADIOBUTTON GROUP gr.:** This line defines another radio button named `p_prod`, which is also part of the same group `gr`. This means that if `p_prod` is selected, `p_test` will be deselected, and vice versa.

```abap
SELECTION-SCREEN END OF BLOCK b2.
```
- **SELECTION-SCREEN END OF BLOCK b2.:** This line marks the end of the selection screen block that was started earlier with `b2`. It indicates that all the parameters and elements related to this block are now complete.

```abap
CURRENT_PAGE_HTML:
```
- **CURRENT_PAGE_HTML:** This is likely another label or identifier for a different section of code, possibly related to HTML output or processing. It suggests that the following code will deal with HTML content.

In summary, this ABAP code creates a selection screen with two radio buttons (`p_test` and `p_prod`) that allow the user to choose between two options. The first radio button is selected by default, and both buttons are part of the same group, ensuring that only one can be selected at a time.
