The provided ABAP code snippet defines a module named `user_command_0001` that handles user commands based on the value of `ok_code`. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Module Declaration**: The module is declared with the name `user_command_0001` and is set to handle input.

2. **CASE Statement**: The code uses a `CASE` statement to evaluate the value of `ok_code`:
- If `ok_code` is either 'BACK' or 'EXIT', the program will leave to screen 0, effectively navigating back to the previous screen.
- If `ok_code` is 'CANCEL', the program will terminate.

3. **End of Module**: The module ends with the `ENDMODULE` statement.

This module is typically used in a dialog program to manage user interactions and navigate through screens based on user commands.
