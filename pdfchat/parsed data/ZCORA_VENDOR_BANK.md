### Summary of the Code:
- The code checks if a certain condition (`p_inc`) is true.
- If true, it checks if two internal tables (`s_date` and `s_time`) are empty. If both are empty, it calls a subroutine.
- It then writes several variables to the output.
- If `p_inc` is not true, it writes different text and the same variables to the output.
- If a certain condition fails, it displays a message and exits to list processing.
- Finally, it clears several variables to reset them before ending the form routine.
Here is the ABAP code along with a simple explanation for each line:

- This line seems to be a label or a section header for the next part of the code, indicating that the following code will deal with HTML content for the current page.

This code is primarily setting up variables and objects for handling table descriptions, display settings, and concatenating strings for output.
Here is the ABAP code you provided, along with a line-by-line explanation in simple English:

```abap
CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT:
* Create instance of ALV table

TRY.
```
- This line starts a block of code that will attempt to execute the following commands. If an error occurs, it can be handled later.

```abap
IF lo_table IS NOT BOUND .
```
- This checks if the variable `lo_table` is not currently assigned to any object (i.e., it is not "bound" to anything).

```abap
cl_salv_table=>factory( IMPORTING
r_salv_table = lo_table
CHANGING
t_table      = gt_output ).
```
- If `lo_table` is not bound, this line creates a new instance of an ALV (ABAP List Viewer) table. It imports the created table into `lo_table` and changes the data in `gt_output` to be displayed in the ALV.

```abap
ENDIF.
```
- This ends the `IF` statement that checks if `lo_table` is not bound.

```abap
lo_table->refresh( ).
```
- This line refreshes the contents of the `lo_table`, ensuring that it displays the latest data.

```abap
DATA(lr_columns) = lo_table->get_columns( ).
```
- Here, a new variable `lr_columns` is created, which holds the columns of the `lo_table`.

```abap
lr_columns->set_optimize( abap_true ).
```
- This line optimizes the display of the columns in the ALV table for better performance or appearance.

```abap
lr_tabledescr_ref ?= cl_abap_typedescr=>describe_by_data( gt_output ).
```
- This line retrieves the type description of the data in `gt_output` and assigns it to `lr_tabledescr_ref`. This helps in understanding the structure of the data.

```abap
lr_descr_ref ?= lr_tabledescr_ref->get_table_line_type( ).
```
- This retrieves the line type of the table description and assigns it to `lr_descr_ref`, which describes the structure of each row in the table.

```abap
LOOP AT lr_descr_ref->components INTO DATA(ls_component).
```
- This starts a loop that goes through each component (column) of the table's structure, assigning each component to the variable `ls_component`.

```abap
IF ls_component-name = c_controller.
```
- Inside the loop, this checks if the name of the current component is equal to `c_controller`.

```abap
TRY.
```
- This begins another block of code that will attempt to execute the following commands, with error handling available.

```abap
lr_column = lr_columns->get_column( c_controller ).
```
- This line retrieves the column corresponding to `c_controller` from the `lr_columns` and assigns it to `lr_column`.

```abap
lr_column->set_visible( abap_false ).
```
- This sets the visibility of the `lr_column` (the column for `c_controller`) to false, meaning it will not be displayed in the ALV table.

```abap
CATCH cx_salv_not_found.                         "#EC NO_HANDLER
```
- This line catches any exceptions (errors) that occur if the column for `c_controller` is not found. The comment indicates that no specific error handling is implemented here.

```abap
ENDTRY.
```
- This ends the `TRY` block that was started earlier.

```abap
ELSE.
```
- This indicates the start of the alternative action if the `IF` condition (checking for `c_controller`) is not met.

```abap
lr_column = lr_columns->get_column( ls_component-name ).
```
- This retrieves the column for the current component (not `c_controller`) and assigns it to `lr_column`.

```abap
lv_scrtext_s = lv_scrtext_m = lv_scrtext_l = ls_component-name+7.
```
- This line assigns a substring of the component's name (starting from the 8th character) to three variables: `lv_scrtext_s`, `lv_scrtext_m`, and `lv_scrtext_l`. This is likely used for display purposes.

```abap
CURRENT_PAGE_HTML:
