The provided ABAP code snippet defines a selection screen for a report or program in SAP. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Data Declarations**:
- Various data elements are declared using the `DATA` statement. These include types from custom tables (e.g., `ztmm_colli`) and standard SAP tables (e.g., `vttk`, `mara`, `ekko`, etc.).

2. **Selection Screen Blocks**:
- The selection screen is divided into several blocks, each with a title and containing different selection options:
- **Block t1**: Contains `SELECT-OPTIONS` for various fields related to handling units and transportation (e.g., `gs_exidv`, `gs_colit`, `gs_tknum`, etc.) and `PARAMETERS` for hub IDs and user information.
- **Block t3**: Contains `SELECT-OPTIONS` for dimensions and weights of handling units (e.g., `gs_vhart`, `gs_laeng`, `gs_breit`, etc.).
- **Block t2**: Contains `PARAMETERS` for additional hub IDs and user information.
- **Block b1**: Contains `SELECT-OPTIONS` for supply chain-related fields (e.g., `gs_suply`, `gs_ebeln`, `gs_matnr`, etc.).
- **Block s1**: Contains a checkbox parameter (`gp_intrl`).

3. **Text Elements**:
- The titles for the blocks are referenced using `text-001`, `text-002`, etc., which are likely defined in a text element or a translation table.

This structure allows users to input various criteria when executing the report, enabling filtering based on handling units, dimensions, weights, supply chain details, and user information.
