The provided ABAP code snippet is part of a report program named `ZRPP_BOM_COM`, which is designed to display information related to bill of materials (BOM) and the pricing of components. Here are some key points about the code:

1. **Report Metadata**:
- **Name**: ZRPP_BOM_COM
- **Transaction Code**: ZBOM_COM
- **Created by**: Soumya Subudhi
- **Creation Date**: 22 Feb 2023
- **Transport Request**: DE3K9A0I78
- **RICEF Object No**: RICEF2614
- **Description**: The report displays info record details along with the price of components.

2. **Version History**:
- The report has an initial version created on 22-Feb-2023 and a quality bug fix on 14-Mar-2023.

3. **Includes**:
- The program includes two other ABAP programs: `zrpp_bom_com_top` and `zrpp_bom_com_f01`, which likely contain the top-level declarations and functional logic, respectively.

4. **Event Handling**:
- The program handles events for the selection screen:
- `AT SELECTION-SCREEN`: Calls the `validate_screen` subroutine to validate user input.
- `AT SELECTION-SCREEN OUTPUT`: Calls the `validate_output` subroutine to manage the output display of the selection screen.

5. **Main Processing Logic**:
- The main processing logic is executed in the `START-OF-SELECTION` event, where it calls three subroutines:
- `get_data`: Presumably retrieves the necessary data for the report.
- `process_data`: Likely processes the retrieved data.
- `build_cat`: Possibly builds a catalog or a structured output based on the processed data.

This structure indicates a well-organized report program that separates concerns through modular subroutines, making it easier to maintain and enhance.
