```abap
DELETE gt_cepc WHERE lock_ind = c_x.
```
- `DELETE gt_cepc WHERE lock_ind = c_x.`: If `p_inact` is empty, this line deletes entries from the internal table `gt_cepc` where the field `lock_ind` equals `c_x` (which is likely a constant representing a specific condition).

```abap
ENDIF.
```
- `ENDIF.`: This marks the end of the `IF` statement that checks `p_inact`.

- `CURRENT_PAGE_HTML:`: This seems to be another label or comment indicating the start of a section related to HTML for the current page.

This code is primarily focused on selecting data from a database table, filtering it based on certain conditions, and then processing that data further based on the results of the selection.
Here is the provided ABAP code with explanations for each line:

```abap
CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT:
AND prctr = gt_cepc-prctr
```
- This line is part of a larger condition (not fully shown here). It checks if the `prctr` (which usually stands for "profit center") in the current context matches the `prctr` from the internal table `gt_cepc`.

```abap
AND bukrs IN s_bukrs1.
```
- This line adds another condition to the previous one, checking if the `bukrs` (company code) is included in the selection range `s_bukrs1`.

ltext
FROM cepct
```
- This line starts another SELECT statement to retrieve the fields `spras`, `prctr`, `datbi`, `kokrs`, `ktext`, and `ltext` from the database table `cepct`. The results of this SELECT are not shown in the provided code snippet, but they would typically be stored in an internal table or processed further.

This code snippet is part of a larger ABAP program that deals with selecting and sorting data based on certain conditions related to profit centers and company codes.
Here is the provided ABAP code along with a line-by-line explanation in simple English:

```abap
CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT:
INTO TABLE gt_cepct
```
- This line indicates that the data from `CURRENT_PAGE_RAW_OCR_TEXT` is being fetched and stored into the internal table `gt_cepct`.

```abap
FOR ALL ENTRIES IN gt_cepc
```
- This line specifies that the following query will be executed for each entry in the internal table `gt_cepc`.

```abap
WHERE spras = sy-langu
```
- This condition filters the entries where the language (`spras`) matches the current system language (`sy-langu`).

```abap
AND prctr = gt_cepc-prctr
```
- This condition ensures that the profit center (`prctr`) in the current entry matches the profit center from the `gt_cepc` table.

```abap
AND datbi GE sy-datum
```
- This condition checks that the end date (`datbi`) is greater than or equal to the current date (`sy-datum`).

```abap
AND kokrs = gt_cepc-kokrs.
```
- This condition filters the entries where the controlling area (`kokrs`) matches the controlling area from the `gt_cepc` table.

```abap
IF sy-subrc = 0.
```
- This line checks if the previous operation was successful (i.e., if any entries were found).

```abap
SORT gt_cepct BY prctr kokrs.
```
- If the previous operation was successful, this line sorts the internal table `gt_cepct` by profit center (`prctr`) and controlling area (`kokrs`).

```abap
ENDIF.

```
- This specifies that a binary search should be used to find the entry in the table, which is faster than a linear search.

```abap
IF sy-subrc = 0.
```
- This line checks if the read operation was successful (i.e., if an entry was found).

```abap
READ TABLE gt_cepct INTO gs_cepct WITH KEY prctr =
gs_cepc_bukrs-prctr
```
- This line attempts to read an entry from the internal table `gt_cepct` into the variable `gs_cepct`, using the profit center from the current `gs_cepc_bukrs`.

```abap
kokrs = gs_cepc_bukrs-kokrs
```
- This line continues the previous command, adding a condition to match the controlling area (`kokrs`) from the current `gs_cepc_bukrs`.

```
- `MODIFY SCREEN.`: This line applies the changes made to the `screen-active` property to the screen.

```abap
ELSE.
```
- `ELSE.`: This line indicates that if the previous condition (screen-group1 = 'M1') is not met, the following block of code will be executed.

```abap

```
- `IF screen-group1 = 'M2'.`: This line checks if the current screen element belongs to the group identified by 'M2'.

```abap
screen-active = 0.
```
- `screen-active = 0.`: If the condition is true, this line sets the `screen-active` property of the current screen element to 0, deactivating or hiding it.

```abap
MODIFY SCREEN.
```
- `MODIFY SCREEN.`: This line applies the changes made to the `screen-active` property to the screen.

```abap
