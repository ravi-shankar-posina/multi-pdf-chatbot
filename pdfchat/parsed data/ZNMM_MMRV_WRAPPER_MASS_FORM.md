The provided ABAP code snippet includes two main forms: `VALIDATE_COMPANY_CODE` and `upd_mmrv`.

1. **VALIDATE_COMPANY_CODE**:
- This form validates company codes by selecting them from the `t001` table based on the input selection table `s_bukrs`.
- If no valid company codes are found (i.e., `sy-subrc` is not equal to 0), it raises an error message indicating that the company code is invalid.

2. **upd_mmrv**:
- This form also selects company codes from the `t001` table into an internal table `lt_t001` based on the same selection criteria (`s_bukrs`).
- It checks if any company codes were found (i.e., `sy-subrc` equals 0) and then processes the found company codes in a loop (though the loop's content is not fully provided in the snippet).

### Key Points:
- The code is designed to handle company code validation and updates related to a specific functionality (likely related to posting in a previous period).
- The author of the code is Himanshu Gupta, and it was created on September 20, 2020.
- The code includes error handling for invalid company codes and uses structured data types for better clarity and maintenance.

The provided ABAP code snippet is part of a batch input process that interacts with the SAP system to perform transactions related to company codes. Here's a breakdown of the key components:

1. **Initialization**:
- The variable `gv_err` is cleared to ensure it starts with no error state.
- The `lw_opt` structure is set with `dismode` as 'N' (no display mode) and `updmode` as 'A' (update mode).

2. **Batch Input Data Preparation**:
- The internal table `gt_bdcdata` is cleared to prepare for new data.
- The `bdc_dynpro` and `bdc_field` subroutines are called to populate `gt_bdcdata` with the necessary program and field values for the transaction.

3. **Transaction Call**:
- The `CALL TRANSACTION` statement is used to execute the transaction 'MMRV' with the prepared batch input data (`gt_bdcdata`), using options from `lw_opt` and capturing messages in `gt_msg`.

4. **Error Handling**:
- After the transaction call, the code checks the `sy-subrc` variable to determine if the transaction was successful. If not, it sets an error message.
- If the transaction is successful, it checks for a specific success message (message type 'S', message ID 'M3', message number '807') in `gt_msg` and displays a success message.

5. **Subroutines**:
- `bdc_dynpro`: This subroutine prepares the batch input data for a specific program and screen (dynpro).
- `bdc_field`: This subroutine prepares the batch input data for specific fields by assigning field names and values.

Overall, this code is structured to handle batch input for a specific SAP transaction, ensuring proper error handling and user feedback based on the transaction's success or failure.
