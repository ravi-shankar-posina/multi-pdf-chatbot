The provided ABAP code snippet appears to be part of a report program. Here's a breakdown of its components:

1. **Initialization Block**:
- The `INITIALIZATION` event is used to set default values for selection screen fields before the screen is displayed.
- In this case, it initializes a selection criterion for a field `s_vbeln` (likely a sales document number) with the following properties:
- `sign` is set to 'E', which typically indicates an exclusion.
- `option` is set to 'CP', which stands for "contains pattern".
- `low` is set to '*3*', meaning it will match any value that contains '3'.

2. **Selection Screen Event**:
- The `AT SELECTION-SCREEN` event is triggered when the user interacts with the selection screen.
- It calls the `validate_input` subroutine to perform input validation.

3. **Start of Selection Event**:
- The `START-OF-SELECTION` event is where the main processing logic of the report begins.
- It calls two subroutines:
- `get_data` to retrieve the necessary data based on the user's input.
- `show_data` to display the retrieved data.
