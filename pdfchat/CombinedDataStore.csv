Hi Suresh,

 

We were told by Amanda Danielson from ERP IT Purchasing team that we would require this transaction to mass upload PIR info in SAP system.

Given the fact that we would be transitioning from contracts to PIRs this month, we need to do mass uploads via Winshuttle and MEMASSIN.

Let me know if you need any further information.

I found one PR (40238851) which was a CAPEX  type and that was released by user id SWAENEPD (David Swaenepoel).Comparing his roles to Spence (user id RICHARDS), Spence will not have the ability to release those since he do not have
the following role: EPUR:IM:REQ_APR:G1:80:1112:PD      PUR - Purchase Req Approval (Plant 1112 $0-$50 000 Cap Ex)

So, if the issue is,  he not able to release those type of PR then site's SAR requester need to kindly ask for the above additional role. 

Also, next time come across a PR that having trouble to release I can set up a Web Ex to try to see the issue- can call me (214)-326-7013 or Jan 402-689-5710

""We've been tracking this for several weeks now, working with Jay Chickerneo and Jeff Marquis. To this point we've been operating under the assumption that the errors experienced are Signal or Wifi/network infrastructiure related.  For the past week we have had active network debugs running for 2 devices in effort to ascertain the root-cause.  Since ~Oct 10 these devices have not had any reports of disconnects. (WIN 417 and WIN 415 are currently tracked.)

We've made some initial investigations but we haven't found any concrete evidence to go on to make any specific changes.  I've done a survey and confirmed that signal levels appear to be within tolerance across the plant.  The areas where events are occurring should have more 
than adequate coverage.  In fact, most of these events are reported to have occurred in areas that have direct line-of-sight to installed APs.   So we're currently stuck until we can capture and analyze some detailed debug information from an event or two.

Items of possible note:
The events appear to be more likely to occur in the morning, centered around 9:00AM EST.
The events appear to be more likely to occur when running ZProdStage transactions.
Often the events are preceeded by very slow transaction response times and application hangs.


I've attached an updated copy of incident tracker I've been compiling.
There is an open service desk incident under INC0121368.""

POs not closed,"Resolution: This ticket fall between FI and PUR areas, and tried  to get guidance from Suresh (our FI support) on this- but he relatively new at THS andnot knowing the process.

Informed customer: to close a PO, in Me22n- item details- delivery tab user can check the Deliv Completed indicator and (also probably in Invoice Tab should check the Final Invoice indicator),

From GR IR discrepancies standpoint:

4500394301 Invoice receipt not done. Appear to be MR11 GR/IR clearing seem to be done for 1558.50.

Following have invoice showing higher amount. Need to know how THS typically handle case like this:               
4500427659 GR is done for 37,800 LB (127,386.00 USD)  and IR 39,900 LB (132,232.99 USD).  
4500433097 GR is done for 9940 LB (14,231.79 USD) and IR 9940 LB (19,546.81 USD).    

Following 4500427666 and 4500427668 are pretty much same case. GR is done for 42,000 LB (141,540.00 USD) and IR 39,900 LB (139,192.62 USD).  Likely the difference between received and invoice, should be  reverse which is 42,000 39,900 = 2100 LB

4500485233: GR is done for 330 LB (4,055.01 USD)  Invoice receipt need to be done. 

Also provided the names who have done the GR and the AP person- if they can offer some guidance. Informed user if need to discuss further, kindly to let us know a good time for you and we can have a meeting to discuss (will ask Suresh/Vania to join).
I can send you Web Ex invite per your convenient time.

Hi Jerry,

We don't use planned delivery times in SAP. The only categories that use planned delivery times are those that use CoPackers.

Also, we should not be manually changing the SPK in ECC. The source list needs to be maintained via the ZAPO_TLANE upload process in APO.

Hi Melanee,

I changed the Special Procurement Key to B1 for Buckner DC but I believe your group still needs to input the Planned Delivery Time for these three items at Carlisle DC 1609.

Yes, the SPT is correct for 1634 DC. These materials are also setup at 1609 DC, which are the ones I believe need to be updated. 1421 Buckner ships to Buckner DC then to the rest of the Network DCs.

Jerry, can you please review the SPTs at 1609 DC for the materials below? The SPT is BK which is Buckner Plant not Buckner DC.

No problem Jenny, I'm adding Jerry Palarz who master schedules Buckner mayo items. These 3 Mayo items below look to already have BK as the SPK at 1634. So we should be good since sourced from 1421 Buckner plant.

Good morning all,

I'm still seeing the SPT as BK. The last change in SAP for Material 95T138C1492 at 1630 DC was on 10/19/19. Would there be a reason that would cause the upload that Carlos did yesterday not to update overnight?

Good morning Melanee, Jenny just contacted me on the items listed below as the SPK changes at 1630 to B1 have been changed back again to BK. These items are sourced from 1634 and not 1421.

I just checked the ZAPO_ TLANE (see below) at 1630 for these items and it looks like these need to be corrected or 1630 SPK changes will continuously be overridden. Do you agree? If so, could somebody fix them while Chandra is out?

Jenny needs them complete for costing purposes.

Jenny, I have updated these. I looked into the history and it looks like these were changed back in early September. The planner making the BK updates is aware of the issue so we should be good going forward.

Can you please update the SPT for Material 95T138C1492 at 1630 DC? Currently it's BK which is Buckner Plant. I believe this needs to be updated to B1 Buckner DC.

SAP Process Order Help Needed please.,"Resolution: According to documentation the barcode for a component is ruled by the WM material staging indicator which is created/maintained in transactions LPK1 / LPK2 and displayed in LPK3.

For this case component 09529005690 doesn't has a control cycle created, we have created control cycle for it having supply area MODS, storage type 100 and Staging Ind. 3 = Release Order Part.

User doesn't have any process order released for now, to confirm if this resolved the issue.

So I have let the user know that I will proceed to close this ticket, but it would be excellent, that when they have a new order that includes this component, to let us know if this worked.  Also if they have any further concerns to let us know or submit a new ticket.

RE: Issue,"Resolution: A master data inconsistency lead to this backward flush error.

So Stace R. and Frank C. gave guidance about how master data must be set up:

MM WIP materials set up:
 - MM MRP2 prod. Stor. Location:  0800 ""Non-HU/WM"" 
- MM Work Schdlng prod. Stor. Loc.:  0800 ""Non-HU/WM""
- MM WM1 special movement indicator:  1 ""Auto 102/WIP""
- Control cycles, supply area RTD-P change from 100/BACKFLUSH to 102/WIP

FG BOMs:
- For WIP material, sort string must contain ""B""

FG PrOs:
1. Delete the WIP item on the process order with the 0900 storage location. 
2. Re-add that item to the process order with the  same quantity.  (This should pull the correct storage location ""0800"" for that material)
3. Add the ""B"" in the sort string field for this new item.
4. Save the PrO

We also had a meeting with Stace and the users and clarified the cause of the issue and agreed on the solution.

If the load hasn't physically left, it has been invoiced (so VL09 won't reverse), we should go through the OS&D (over, short,& damage- OSD@treehousefoods.com)  and essentially a virtual return for STOs and connecting with the CSR for a customer order.

order 10604691 20549806,"Resolution: A master data inconsistency lead to this backward flush error.

So Stace R. and Frank C.gave guidance about how master data must be set up:

MM WIP materials set up:
 - MM MRP2 prod. Stor. Location:  0800 ""Non-HU/WM"" 
- MM Work Schdlng prod. Stor. Loc.:  0800 ""Non-HU/WM""
- MM WM1 special movement indicator:  1 ""Auto 102/WIP""
- Control cycles, supply area RTD-P change from 100/BACKFLUSH to 102/WIP

FG BOMs:
- For WIP material, sort string must contain ""B""

FG PrOs:
1. Delete the WIP item on the process order with the 0900 storage location. 
2. Re-add that item to the process order with the  same quantity.  (This should pull the correct storage location ""0800"" for that material)
3. Add the ""B"" in the sort string field for this new item.
4. Save the PrO

We also had a meeting with Stace and the users and clarified the cause of the issue and agreed on the solution.

Backfush items in SAP.,"Resolution: We was reviewing all the master data for the concerned components, and we found that material master need to be update for components G30001530000 and G40121530105 which are the ones appearing with the Backflush flag on the process orders.  

To correct this the user's in charge for maintaining master data in your plant need to go to transaction MM02 and then go to MRP2 view and blank the Backflush field and save the changes, in both materials. 

This action will correct the future Process Orders, but there are around 20 orders already created and some of those are released, the above will not correct these ones.

To correct the Process Order that already exists in SAP, someone from production at your site, will need to do it one by one manually, in transaction COR2, enter the process order number and then go to material list 

Then, uncheck the backflush flag from there  and save the changes

The master data has been updated by user side, he confirmed the issue should be resolved now.

SAP Help on Attaching a Document Error,"Resolution: Sent following guidance to user:
I look at one SAP note  it hinted that when create attachment with .csv extension this error can occur. If its .csv maybe can save it in some other format- then try. 
Well even if different type of file, maybe if you might try to save in different format (like from Word to PDF) and see if that work. If  is it a very large attachment (maybe more than 5 MB)  may be problematic..
can check right click on the document (in file explorer).   properties Also the error seem to indicate it could be GUI relatedso maybe can try to log in to SAP from different computer and try. That could hint towards maybe SAPGUI or something local to your laptop.
In that case, can turn in a ticket asking for Desktop Team to re-install SAP GUI

Hu issuing problem,"Resolution: SMEs from QA cleared the inspection lot from the HU , we have reviewed the process order and the HU was consumed to it. 

QA determined that HU 100418202807969463 on inspection lot 10000328673 had not been posted from QI stock.  There were three HU's on the inspection lot and the other two had been posted to unrestricted stock. Then checked HUMO and the HU was not on blocked stock.

QA attempted to post the HU to unrestricted stock from the inspection lot change usage decision screen, but received an error message that the material was in in QI stock. Then used HUMO to post the HU back into QI stock, and then posted the HU on the inspection lot usage decision screen to unrestricted stock.

Most likely someone used HUMO to post the HU from QI to unrestricted stock, when the HU should have been posted with the usage decision transaction.

At this point we are assuming that issue has been resolved, we have informed this to the user, letting her know that we are going to close the ticket but if they have further concerns on this or other issue, to kindly submit a new ticket.

FW: 12160120443 - 8/64 MAR PARM GARLIC-HOOTR,"Resolution: 24 CS of 12160120443 are the result of the below 303 movement type executed last year. Movement types 303 (remove from the source location) and 305 (place in receiving location) are the movement types for a transfer between plants but w/o a transfer order. In this case only the 303 movement type was entered and hence when you look at MMBE or MB52 these 24 CS are displayed in the ""Stck trans.(plnt)"" bucket.
To resolve, business user cancelled the 303 mvmt type with a 304 movement type and then scrapped with a 551 movement type.

FW: The 673190n0664 went back to 90D,"Resolution: The following was noted with regard to this ticket.

e system is putting back to 090D as the current SLED/BBD for batch 10A11029 was updated from 11/02/2020 to 01/02/2020 and per the current ""Minimum Remaining Shelf Life"" and ""Total shelf life"" values, this is treated as distressed stock.

The original SLED/BBD is calculated based on Date of Manufacture (11/02/2019) + Total shelf life (366 days) = 11/02/2020, but for some reason it was changed last Monday to its current SLED/BBD value of 01/02/2020 (change was executed by SAP ID MAHONEYM  Mary Mahoney).

To avoid this from happening, your QA will need to adjust back the SLED/BBD or revisit the ""Minimum Remaining Shelf Life"" and ""Total shelf life"" values in the material master for 673190N0664 and update accordingly.

G0990,"Resolution: There is a program with variants and jobs set up to do an auto issue to a cost center for certain materials.

The program is - ZMFGE505_AUTO_GI_CC

The job for plant 1117 is - ZE_MFG_X_E505_1117_CURR_H and runs every hour.

The job has 4 steps calling each of 4 variants that are set up  - 

CUS&1117_CURR            - Issues inventory from a PSA storage types for any materials that have the bulk flag set on them to cost center 11700
CUS&1117_CURR2          - Issues inventory from storage types 100, 134, 135, 140, 145, 146, 147 for materials S10000530308, S10530010060, S10000530206, S05100530022 to CC 11700
CUS&1117_CURR3          - Issues inventory from storage type 148 for material G20600530003 to CC 11700
CUS&1117_CURR4          - Issues inventory from storage type 135, storage bin BAY4 for material G38000462000 to CC 11700

Basically, the first variant exists to issue any materials that are flagged as bulk item (i.e. non-BOM items) from any PSA bin.

The other 3 variants cover some exception items that are really BOM items that are used in the production process in some places, but in other area of the plant the same material is used as a production supply item that we want to issue then the move the inventory to those areas.

So, since G0990 is really a BOM items we would need another exception and could add a new variant - 

CUS&1117_CURR5          - Issues inventory from storage type 134, storage bin BAY84 for material G0990 to CC 11700

And then have Basis team add that step to the job.

We informed the user that We have submitted defect 27198 - MFG - ZMFGE505_AUTO_GI_CC update to add an exception for component G0990 to program ZMFGE505_AUTO_GI_CC. Now we need to wait for MFG Business Architect approval, this may take a couple of days. 

As for now, our regular process after having a defect is to close the ticket, so I will proceed to close it, but this doesn't mean that the issue has been resolved, we will keep working on it by Defect number and keep the following up through this email chain.

Be advised that the back dating can only work if the date you enter is for an accounting period or material period that is still open.  These are usually open for a couple of days at the start of the month so that clean up of transactions can be done.  For example:

1. Current date is 11/01/2019 and you use the posting date 10/31/2019  this likely will be able to be processed.
2. Current Date is 11/10/2019 and the posting date of 10/31/2019  this would fail, but any date entered for November should work.

Hi Wesley,
On LX02, if you filter by material S820 in storage location 0800 for that batch (below left) then total the amount on the result screen (below right) there is only 661.716 LB available in the 0800 storage location.  (The system will not allow the 0800 storage location to go negative.)

The issue is that there is -2450 LB of the same material/batch in storage bin TRBT124  that is off-setting the positive amounts in the other bins.   Can you move some of the positive inventory to the bin with the negative amount so that the system will reflect the true amount in 0800?
Thanks,

"Customers - Technical Field Name, Table Name, Field Length","Resolution: the field names, table names, field length, etc for Customer fields in ECP and EMP have been provided.",,
SAP - Pallet Type,"Resolution: After reviewing this incident we found that all three materials 800293T4181, 800294T4181, 800308T0796 are set with the Default Packaging type GMA, from the material master Treehouse Data tab, Manufacturing I section.

Also we reached the Business Experts and the clarified that ZGRPROD won't default the packing material.  That option has been incorporated into the auto GR, but the manual GRPROD doesn't have that. 
When tested some items in ECQ, the pack material was remaining after receiving a pallet for an order.  Also, when switching the process order, the pack material blanked out, so it wouldn't be carrying over PEC from a previous process order if that was a concern.

For Alternative option , please try to count the inventory using the below transaction : 

1 ) LI01N : Created a inventory record for the Bin 21008B and activate it . 

2) LI11N :  Enter the count details and save . 

3) LI20 : Clear the inventory record at Warehouse level . 

Note : If there any difference in counts check with your inventory controller to clear the inventory record using LI21 ( which will clear at inventory level )  .  If there is no difference no need of this .  

we will check with SAP to clear the below inventory record and we will update you once SAP corrected the inventory record .

issue with ZAPO T-lane,"Resolution: Hi Lori,
The error occurs because the existing trans lane is blocked. Active AND Blocked trans lanes cause overlap when a new trans lane is created with the same or overlapping duration.

This existing trans lane should be set to D (deletion flag instead of X  blocked). Trans lanes with deletion flag do not cause overlap when a new trans lane is created with overlapping duration.

Please download the trans lane via ZAPO_TLANE, set it to D and then create a new trans lane .

SAP APO Sales History missing for cereal for channel 5,"Resolution: 12/11: Informed Donna about old ticket.

12/12: As per Donna.

I I met with Anne Sprout and Kelly Carey. What we found was there are several customers that are in channel 5 that need to be moved to the distressed channel 8. There are a few that need to move to Retail channel 001.   What will probably remain in channel 5 are things like prisons and employee sales. We will probably not want to forecast those, so am assuming that once it is cleaned up, we will continue to want to exclude channel 5 from APO. 
Please close the ticket. 
Thank you,
Donna

Dolly,

Reported Issue:
Check 10464368 was paid out of ECP on 4/10/19 in the amount of $9510.38

This check needed voiding, however it does not exist in EMP

I need the payment document in EMP in order to have the void properly processed

I processed the void of the check in ECP, I'm sure it is stuck in the AIF as it has nowhere to post to.

Analysis from ASG Team:

I went through the issue and observed the below:

The referenced Invoice paid in EMP by entering invoice manually. Below are the information of the same.

The Invoice already paid in EMP, you might have noticed the same.
Please check the document numbers in EMP in Vendor 409734 Account

1900382577  - Invoice
2000155478  - Payment  Ch No 50001171 and it was cashed.

In ECP:

On 4/10/2019 Payment made through check 10464368 as you mentioned  invoice 14727 dt 7/31/2018

Payment Document # 2000586790 dt 4/10/2019 

This payment was reversed with Document 2000587130  reversal of payment which is stuck in AIF, because there is no prior invoice and payment documents.

Now we need to record the invoice though it was paid in EMP, may be in 66995 vendor, and record a payment documents

then we can refer the two documents in AIF error and can process the reversal document.

It should be done manually, pl let us know who can enter these documents in EMP production system.

If you approve we can use FF user ID and can record these transactions but it is not the practice  we follow, we request business to record the transactions.

We can connect first hour in the morning and can complete this process.

Thanks,

Suresh Manukonda

These notifications are sent for PO invoice related issues from VIM.  When a GR is required, for example, the recipient also receives the work item in their SAP (SBWP) and (if they have access) VIM (/n/opt/vim_wp) workplaces.

The recipient is set at the plant level and the AP management should be notified if the receiver or buyer for the plant is not correct.  They can have this updated.
The RECEIVER is typically a Plant Controller or their designee, and plant assignments can be individual or within a numbered range.  

Kindly asking customer to pass this information to the respective usersthat as Jason mentions they need to contact their AP management if receiver is not correct. 
For the receiver of the email then to and kindly pass the notification on for whomever invoice processing. Or if email point to some issue with PO use t-code ME23n <P O #>  and look up the PO creator. Or GR is problem from purchase order -> double click on material document-> Doc info tab- can show the person who has done the goods receipt on the PO., if the problem lie with GR.

Pete,

I've also talked with Rob Morrow, who tells me Mark Donnelly is helping you with the upgrade. Rob says he might be able to help copy data from the old version to the new version if needed until the new server is in production. Added him to this email.

As it appears MII is doing what is expected (sending data to the system as we know), I would recommend closing this ticket. If/when you want to switch to sending orders to the new system, please let myself or Frank Conrad know the details of the new server, and a time/date when the change should take place. We will need to work with the SAP Basis team to make the changes, so please give us some advance notice so these arrangements can be made.

SAP Material Pricing Issue,"Resolution: Passed following guidance to customers:
-I saw there are similar parts have been set up at the plant previously, (for example M00102567) this also is type of grease) can be used as reference.
- ZPM_INV is just a report that picks up the moving average price, there is no issue with that. By the way, you are not going to affect moving average price (how it's shown in ZPM_INV) with how Irene set up Info record /conditions (those will affect purchase order not ZPM_INV). 
 - Provided some errors that need to be corrected in info record. 
 
As far as the price is higher in material masters currentlyare showing for EA this happened,
Because the material master initially set up base unit EA   and then later time it was changed to Gallon but price is still showing for EA. 

To correct the pricing now,kindly need to check FIN - Cost Accountant - Pretzel Plants  (Amanda Wilhelm, Darniece Toaltoan, Todd Gallegos) please contact them on this issue, likely transaction MR21 needs to be ran

Tammy may have removed the alerts from one of the tabs under Edit Planning View, but likely did not remove the alerts from the other tab. Alerts for that template are on the 1st and 3rd tabs. Alternatively, instead of removing the alert from the view, she can also select the correct version in the version dropdown on the alerts tab. Attaching picture here. I'm not sure there is anything that needs to be changed on a dev/IT side. Hope this helps.

You can close the ticket. This isn't a support issue. Adding LeAnn. 

LeAnn please take this one, check email string. Organize a half hour call with JoAnn Capone and Add Jennifer Izzo and me, about the below Q&A. 

1) Transportation instructions text, from the sales order, are intended for BluJay-> Comments area of the order. These specific instructions have been typed in or defaulted so as to send to BluJay, AND / OR to also be printed on the BOL in special instructions. 

2) If they are requesting hard coding this comment on ALL BOLs:  

1) Is this only from Canadian locations to the US? 
2) Is it specifically just for the BOL? 
3) WE HAVE A MATERIAL SPECIFIC Organic/GMO material indicator that if checked I believe shows somewhere in the PACKING LIST. This may be sufficient. Not ALL of our materials are ORGANIC are they? Why would we hard code this comment on all BOLs?

Hi,

We also need to have Customer Service put in block requests through MDG Customer to block the ship-tos in sales org 2000.  That will allow the forecast to show up under 1100.  We need to have these requests put in before the refresh over the weekend.

Bethany  can you work on putting in these requests?  I believe Niki has a list of ship-tos that should be blocked in 2000.

Checking up on this email chain if we got the below info? The PO in this email chain for Wakefern came over to SAP as ED Smith Sales Org 2000 and you can see from their screen shot they wrote it to EDS. 
This order was created yesterday and is shipping after the new year so needs to be updated to BVF as the vendor.  
Joanne or Ed can you please request that?
 
Orders created today for Wakefern did pull 1100 BVF Sales Org.

Jon:
 
Do you have a list of ship-to/material combinations for this change?
 
I checked for example Wakerfern (31006), there are 30 some ship-tos for Wakerfern. But using Katherine's material list in her spreadsheet, maybe only one Wakerfern ship-to (202864) is in scope for this change.

David

What is the total scope of this issue?
 
At the beginning of this email, it was just speaking about Wakefern.  Now Wegmans is mentioned.
 
Is it that all Wakefern (Cust Hier 31006) and all Wegmans (Cust Hier 31018) items (in all product hierarchies) that were previously CA will now be US?
 
Or, is the change more granular than that?

I can realign the CVCs from CA to US in APO.  We need orders to be processed as US instead of CA, though.  I see open orders coming into APO as CA.

Imran/Maggie,
Can you help with this issue?
There was a sales org re-alignment that happened for Wakefern ship-tos. 
They are not showing up correctly in APO DP. 
 
Eddie,
Can you share specifics around ship-to and SKUs on these?
 
Thanks,
Vikram

Hello Imran

 

I believe Sid helped load the file to Production - (/ibpreference/prd/work/Warehouse_Manual_File.csv) the last time. For future reference, the excel file you sent has a worksheet named SHERRI2 which is saved as a .csv format (attached ). Once the file has been loaded in Production the existing Master Data Job will process the new file as intended.

 

@Basis can you please help drop the attached csv file in the Production folder path  - /ibpreference/prd/work/

Copying Sai as well, so he is also aware of this process.

 

 

Kind Regards

 

Vivienne

Hi Suresh,

 

We were told by Amanda Danielson from ERP IT Purchasing team that we would require this transaction to mass upload PIR info in SAP system.

Given the fact that we would be transitioning from contracts to PIRs this month, we need to do mass uploads via Winshuttle and MEMASSIN.

Let me know if you need any further information.

,,Access to GR55 in SAP,"Resolution: Yes.  I am not sure why GR55 is not Excel-friendly with Office 365, but I need to have Office 365 to churn thru the reserve files that we work with at month-end.  If there is ever a fix or upgrade available I'd like to be first in line because taking GR55 to Excel now is very cumbersome.

Dave,

 

I can resolve 1 of the 2 issues for Kelly.

 

We can only provide an ID in SCQ. She will be sent her logon information shortly.

 

The originally reported issues. Logon Balancing error is something that the desktop team needs to resolve, as that is a PC issue and not security related.

He already has access to SAP APO production and is able to logon and edit that system.  When trying to logon to QAS, he gets the attached ""logon balancing error 88"" message.

,,Transfer Order #0000523352 locked out.,"Resolution: Issue is being worked by local IT team per Rob Adams:

""We've been tracking this for several weeks now, working with Jay Chickerneo and Jeff Marquis. To this point we've been operating under the assumption that the errors experienced are Signal or Wifi/network infrastructiure related.  For the past week we have had active network debugs running for 2 devices in effort to ascertain the root-cause.  Since ~Oct 10 these devices have not had any reports of disconnects. (WIN 417 and WIN 415 are currently tracked.)

We've made some initial investigations but we haven't found any concrete evidence to go on to make any specific changes.  I've done a survey and confirmed that signal levels appear to be within tolerance across the plant.  The areas where events are occurring should have more 
than adequate coverage.  In fact, most of these events are reported to have occurred in areas that have direct line-of-sight to installed APs.   So we're currently stuck until we can capture and analyze some detailed debug information from an event or two.

Items of possible note:
The events appear to be more likely to occur in the morning, centered around 9:00AM EST.
The events appear to be more likely to occur when running ZProdStage transactions.
Often the events are preceeded by very slow transaction response times and application hangs.


I've attached an updated copy of incident tracker I've been compiling.
There is an open service desk incident under INC0121368.""

,,POs not closed,"Resolution: This ticket fall between FI and PUR areas, and tried  to get guidance from Suresh (our FI support) on this- but he relatively new at THS andnot knowing the process.

Informed customer: to close a PO, in Me22n- item details- delivery tab user can check the Deliv Completed indicator and (also probably in Invoice Tab should check the Final Invoice indicator),

From GR IR discrepancies standpoint:

4500394301 Invoice receipt not done. Appear to be MR11 GR/IR clearing seem to be done for 1558.50.

Following have invoice showing higher amount. Need to know how THS typically handle case like this:               
4500427659 GR is done for 37,800 LB (127,386.00 USD)  and IR 39,900 LB (132,232.99 USD).  
4500433097 GR is done for 9940 LB (14,231.79 USD) and IR 9940 LB (19,546.81 USD).    

Following 4500427666 and 4500427668 are pretty much same case. GR is done for 42,000 LB (141,540.00 USD) and IR 39,900 LB (139,192.62 USD).  Likely the difference between received and invoice, should be  reverse which is 42,000 39,900 = 2100 LB

4500485233: GR is done for 330 LB (4,055.01 USD)  Invoice receipt need to be done. 

Also provided the names who have done the GR and the AP person- if they can offer some guidance. Informed user if need to discuss further, kindly to let us know a good time for you and we can have a meeting to discuss (will ask Suresh/Vania to join).
I can send you Web Ex invite per your convenient time.

Aaron's Response:
If the load hasn't physically left, it has been invoiced (so VL09 won't reverse), we should go through the OS&D (over, short,& damage- OSD@treehousefoods.com)  and essentially a virtual return for STOs and connecting with the CSR for a customer order.  The reasoning is we've encountered significant issues when trying to reverse (different company code, customer orders that the customer has already been invoiced, etc.).

Hi all,

We costed these materials with the SPT of B1. They were changed back to BK via upload yesterday.

Jerry can you please submit a ticket to service desk to get this issue resolved?

Hi Jerry,

We don't use planned delivery times in SAP. The only categories that use planned delivery times are those that use CoPackers.

Also, we should not be manually changing the SPK in ECC. The source list needs to be maintained via the ZAPO_TLANE upload process in APO.

Hi Melanee,

I changed the Special Procurement Key to B1 for Buckner DC but I believe your group still needs to input the Planned Delivery Time for these three items at Carlisle DC 1609.

Yes, the SPT is correct for 1634 DC. These materials are also setup at 1609 DC, which are the ones I believe need to be updated. 1421 Buckner ships to Buckner DC then to the rest of the Network DCs.

Jerry, can you please review the SPTs at 1609 DC for the materials below? The SPT is BK which is Buckner Plant not Buckner DC.

No problem Jenny, I'm adding Jerry Palarz who master schedules Buckner mayo items. These 3 Mayo items below look to already have BK as the SPK at 1634. So we should be good since sourced from 1421 Buckner plant.

I'm still seeing the SPT as BK. The last change in SAP for Material 95T138C1492 at 1630 DC was on 10/19/19. Would there be a reason that would cause the upload that Carlos did yesterday not to update overnight?

Good morning Melanee, Jenny just contacted me on the items listed below as the SPK changes at 1630 to B1 have been changed back again to BK. These items are sourced from 1634 and not 1421.

I just checked the ZAPO_ TLANE (see below) at 1630 for these items and it looks like these need to be corrected or 1630 SPK changes will continuously be overridden. Do you agree? If so, could somebody fix them while Chandra is out?

Jenny needs them complete for costing purposes.

,,RE: Issue,"Resolution: A master data inconsistency lead to this backward flush error.

So Stace R. and Frank C. gave guidance about how master data must be set up:

MM WIP materials set up:
 - MM MRP2 prod. Stor. Location:  0800 ""Non-HU/WM"" 
- MM Work Schdlng prod. Stor. Loc.:  0800 ""Non-HU/WM""
- MM WM1 special movement indicator:  1 ""Auto 102/WIP""
- Control cycles, supply area RTD-P change from 100/BACKFLUSH to 102/WIP

FG BOMs:
- For WIP material, sort string must contain ""B""

FG PrOs:
1. Delete the WIP item on the process order with the 0900 storage location. 
2. Re-add that item to the process order with the  same quantity.  (This should pull the correct storage location ""0800"" for that material)
3. Add the ""B"" in the sort string field for this new item.
4. Save the PrO

We also had a meeting with Stace and the users and clarified the cause of the issue and agreed on the solution.

Scrap the 80 BUCs qty using MIGO -> Goods issue -> Other -> Movement type 551. Enter Material, Qty, Plant, Storage Location (0900), Reason for Movement and Batch (6910280). Also you will need to provide a cost center to proceed with the scrap movement. Also a job aid for this is also attached in here.

,,Reversing Hu's in SAP,"Resolution: Please do the following in order to reverse the pallets  : 

1. Execute MIGO , select Goods Receipt from drop down ,  choose order from drop down  , Enter order number 10634350 and enter movement type as 102 . Then execute . 
2. Enter the quantity as 666 in quantity tab , make sure  stock type should be unrestricted in where tab. 
3.  Click on item ok , check and post . It will create an outbound delivery number .

If the load hasn't physically left, it has been invoiced (so VL09 won't reverse), we should go through the OS&D (over, short,& damage- OSD@treehousefoods.com)  and essentially a virtual return for STOs and connecting with the CSR for a customer order.

To correct this the user's in charge for maintaining master data in your plant need to go to transaction MM02 and then go to MRP2 view and blank the Backflush field and save the changes, in both materials. 

This action will correct the future Process Orders, but there are around 20 orders already created and some of those are released, the above will not correct these ones.

To correct the Process Order that already exists in SAP, someone from production at your site, will need to do it one by one manually, in transaction COR2, enter the process order number and then go to material list 

Then, uncheck the backflush flag from there  and save the changes

The master data has been updated by user side, he confirmed the issue should be resolved now.

Well even if different type of file, maybe if you might try to save in different format (like from Word to PDF) and see if that work. If  is it a very large attachment (maybe more than 5 MB)  may be problematic..
can check right click on the document (in file explorer).   properties Also the error seem to indicate it could be GUI relatedso maybe can try to log in to SAP from different computer and try. That could hint towards maybe SAPGUI or something local to your laptop.
In that case, can turn in a ticket asking for Desktop Team to re-install SAP GUI

,,Hu issuing problem,"Resolution: SMEs from QA cleared the inspection lot from the HU , we have reviewed the process order and the HU was consumed to it. 

QA determined that HU 100418202807969463 on inspection lot 10000328673 had not been posted from QI stock.  There were three HU's on the inspection lot and the other two had been posted to unrestricted stock. Then checked HUMO and the HU was not on blocked stock.

QA attempted to post the HU to unrestricted stock from the inspection lot change usage decision screen, but received an error message that the material was in in QI stock. Then used HUMO to post the HU back into QI stock, and then posted the HU on the inspection lot usage decision screen to unrestricted stock.

Most likely someone used HUMO to post the HU from QI to unrestricted stock, when the HU should have been posted with the usage decision transaction.

At this point we are assuming that issue has been resolved, we have informed this to the user, letting her know that we are going to close the ticket but if they have further concerns on this or other issue, to kindly submit a new ticket.

,,FW: 12160120443 - 8/64 MAR PARM GARLIC-HOOTR,"Resolution: 24 CS of 12160120443 are the result of the below 303 movement type executed last year. Movement types 303 (remove from the source location) and 305 (place in receiving location) are the movement types for a transfer between plants but w/o a transfer order. In this case only the 303 movement type was entered and hence when you look at MMBE or MB52 these 24 CS are displayed in the ""Stck trans.(plnt)"" bucket.
To resolve, business user cancelled the 303 mvmt type with a 304 movement type and then scrapped with a 551 movement type.

,,FW: The 673190n0664 went back to 90D,"Resolution: The following was noted with regard to this ticket.

e system is putting back to 090D as the current SLED/BBD for batch 10A11029 was updated from 11/02/2020 to 01/02/2020 and per the current ""Minimum Remaining Shelf Life"" and ""Total shelf life"" values, this is treated as distressed stock.

The original SLED/BBD is calculated based on Date of Manufacture (11/02/2019) + Total shelf life (366 days) = 11/02/2020, but for some reason it was changed last Monday to its current SLED/BBD value of 01/02/2020 (change was executed by SAP ID MAHONEYM  Mary Mahoney).

To avoid this from happening, your QA will need to adjust back the SLED/BBD or revisit the ""Minimum Remaining Shelf Life"" and ""Total shelf life"" values in the material master for 673190N0664 and update accordingly.

CUS&1117_CURR3          - Issues inventory from storage type 148 for material G20600530003 to CC 11700
CUS&1117_CURR4          - Issues inventory from storage type 135, storage bin BAY4 for material G38000462000 to CC 11700

Basically, the first variant exists to issue any materials that are flagged as bulk item (i.e. non-BOM items) from any PSA bin.

The other 3 variants cover some exception items that are really BOM items that are used in the production process in some places, but in other area of the plant the same material is used as a production supply item that we want to issue then the move the inventory to those areas.

So, since G0990 is really a BOM items we would need another exception and could add a new variant - 

CUS&1117_CURR5          - Issues inventory from storage type 134, storage bin BAY84 for material G0990 to CC 11700

And then have Basis team add that step to the job.

We informed the user that We have submitted defect 27198 - MFG - ZMFGE505_AUTO_GI_CC update to add an exception for component G0990 to program ZMFGE505_AUTO_GI_CC. Now we need to wait for MFG Business Architect approval, this may take a couple of days. 

As for now, our regular process after having a defect is to close the ticket, so I will proceed to close it, but this doesn't mean that the issue has been resolved, we will keep working on it by Defect number and keep the following up through this email chain.

,,RE: Reprocess Help,"Resolution: It is only possible to back date an entry for those transactions / screens that have the field posting date in them.  Be advised that the back dating can only work if the date you enter is for an accounting period or material period that is still open.  These are usually open for a couple of days at the start of the month so that clean up of transactions can be done.  For example:

1. Current date is 11/01/2019 and you use the posting date 10/31/2019  this likely will be able to be processed.
2. Current Date is 11/10/2019 and the posting date of 10/31/2019  this would fail, but any date entered for November should work.

Subject: RE: THS SAP issue ORDER 20561234 Ticket= INC0143047

Hi Wesley,
On LX02, if you filter by material S820 in storage location 0800 for that batch (below left) then total the amount on the result screen (below right) there is only 661.716 LB available in the 0800 storage location.  (The system will not allow the 0800 storage location to go negative.)

The issue is that there is -2450 LB of the same material/batch in storage bin TRBT124  that is off-setting the positive amounts in the other bins.   Can you move some of the positive inventory to the bin with the negative amount so that the system will reflect the true amount in 0800?
Thanks,
Frank

Also we reached the Business Experts and the clarified that ZGRPROD won't default the packing material.  That option has been incorporated into the auto GR, but the manual GRPROD doesn't have that. 
When tested some items in ECQ, the pack material was remaining after receiving a pallet for an order.  Also, when switching the process order, the pack material blanked out, so it wouldn't be carrying over PEC from a previous process order if that was a concern. 

They can review a future enhancement for GRPROD to pull in the packing material, but that would be more long-term in timing though.

We also give transaction ZHUCHANGE to the user, to fix the packaging type after the wrong one has been entered, with the link to the step by step THS Training Document.

1 ) LI01N : Created a inventory record for the Bin 21008B and activate it . 

2) LI11N :  Enter the count details and save . 

3) LI20 : Clear the inventory record at Warehouse level . 

Note : If there any difference in counts check with your inventory controller to clear the inventory record using LI21 ( which will clear at inventory level )  .  If there is no difference no need of this .  

we will check with SAP to clear the below inventory record and we will update you once SAP corrected the inventory record .

,,issue with ZAPO T-lane,"Resolution: Hi Lori,
The error occurs because the existing trans lane is blocked. Active AND Blocked trans lanes cause overlap when a new trans lane is created with the same or overlapping duration.

This existing trans lane should be set to D (deletion flag instead of X  blocked). Trans lanes with deletion flag do not cause overlap when a new trans lane is created with overlapping duration.

Please download the trans lane via ZAPO_TLANE, set it to D and then create a new trans lane .


12/10: Lori is good with ZAPO_TLANE now.

,,SAP APO Sales History missing for cereal for channel 5,"Resolution: 12/11: Informed Donna about old ticket.

12/12: As per Donna.

I I met with Anne Sprout and Kelly Carey. What we found was there are several customers that are in channel 5 that need to be moved to the distressed channel 8. There are a few that need to move to Retail channel 001.   What will probably remain in channel 5 are things like prisons and employee sales. We will probably not want to forecast those, so am assuming that once it is cleaned up, we will continue to want to exclude channel 5 from APO. 
Please close the ticket. 
Thank you,
Donna

Set Internet Explorer Zoom to 100%
IE tools > Zoom > 100%
 
Then also from same screenshot I see chrome say the site is not secure, I think this should not be an issue on IE but if you still see that Not secure site message. Do the following:

Add https://*.thssap to IE trusted sites IE options > Internet Explorer Options > Security > Trusted Sites > Sites > Add

Dolly,

Reported Issue:
Check 10464368 was paid out of ECP on 4/10/19 in the amount of $9510.38

This check needed voiding, however it does not exist in EMP

I need the payment document in EMP in order to have the void properly processed

I processed the void of the check in ECP, I'm sure it is stuck in the AIF as it has nowhere to post to.

Analysis from ASG Team:

I went through the issue and observed the below:

The referenced Invoice paid in EMP by entering invoice manually. Below are the information of the same.

The Invoice already paid in EMP, you might have noticed the same.
Please check the document numbers in EMP in Vendor 409734 Account

1900382577  - Invoice
2000155478  - Payment  Ch No 50001171 and it was cashed.

In ECP:

On 4/10/2019 Payment made through check 10464368 as you mentioned  invoice 14727 dt 7/31/2018

Payment Document # 2000586790 dt 4/10/2019 

This payment was reversed with Document 2000587130  reversal of payment which is stuck in AIF, because there is no prior invoice and payment documents.

Now we need to record the invoice though it was paid in EMP, may be in 66995 vendor, and record a payment documents

then we can refer the two documents in AIF error and can process the reversal document.

It should be done manually, pl let us know who can enter these documents in EMP production system.

If you approve we can use FF user ID and can record these transactions but it is not the practice  we follow, we request business to record the transactions.

We can connect first hour in the morning and can complete this process.

Thanks,

Suresh Manukonda

The other outputs all locations have been using for years are:

ZPL0   TRF Pack List
These are the standard POST PGI packing lists that print automatically.  

We never set the PRE PRINT output up for any other locations. Now recently we have it for the NE DC, so I assume the SE DC wants it also. 

Aaron if other facilities need to PRE PRINT (I think we started this at Buckner for the DC go-live, then used it also for Pretzel plants) then the VV21 master data needs to be set up. I'll do that now for SEDC, and they need to follow the attached VL71 instructions.""

These notifications are sent for PO invoice related issues from VIM.  When a GR is required, for example, the recipient also receives the work item in their SAP (SBWP) and (if they have access) VIM (/n/opt/vim_wp) workplaces.

The recipient is set at the plant level and the AP management should be notified if the receiver or buyer for the plant is not correct.  They can have this updated.
The RECEIVER is typically a Plant Controller or their designee, and plant assignments can be individual or within a numbered range.  

Kindly asking customer to pass this information to the respective usersthat as Jason mentions they need to contact their AP management if receiver is not correct. 
For the receiver of the email then to and kindly pass the notification on for whomever invoice processing. Or if email point to some issue with PO use t-code ME23n <P O #>  and look up the PO creator. Or GR is problem from purchase order -> double click on material document-> Doc info tab- can show the person who has done the goods receipt on the PO., if the problem lie with GR.

Pete,

I've also talked with Rob Morrow, who tells me Mark Donnelly is helping you with the upgrade. Rob says he might be able to help copy data from the old version to the new version if needed until the new server is in production. Added him to this email.

As it appears MII is doing what is expected (sending data to the system as we know), I would recommend closing this ticket. If/when you want to switch to sending orders to the new system, please let myself or Frank Conrad know the details of the new server, and a time/date when the change should take place. We will need to work with the SAP Basis team to make the changes, so please give us some advance notice so these arrangements can be made.

Ranji:  Just wanted to confirm that what Shawn indicated is correct.   You cannot change the  vendor # on an existing PO.  To correct, please delete/trash can the PO with the incorrect vendor # and create a new PO using the correct vendor 15834.

Having said the above, there is not a current contract in place for S2208 using vendor 15834, Numi Tea.   Need to have a contract/source list in place before the PO is generated.

-I saw there are similar parts have been set up at the plant previously, (for example M00102567) this also is type of grease) can be used as reference.
- ZPM_INV is just a report that picks up the moving average price, there is no issue with that. By the way, you are not going to affect moving average price (how it's shown in ZPM_INV) with how Irene set up Info record /conditions (those will affect purchase order not ZPM_INV). 
 - Provided some errors that need to be corrected in info record. 
 
As far as the price is higher in material masters currentlyare showing for EA this happened,
Because the material master initially set up base unit EA   and then later time it was changed to Gallon but price is still showing for EA. 

To correct the pricing now,kindly need to check FIN - Cost Accountant - Pretzel Plants  (Amanda Wilhelm, Darniece Toaltoan, Todd Gallegos) please contact them on this issue, likely transaction MR21 needs to be ran

Alternatively, instead of removing the alert from the view, she can also select the correct version in the version dropdown on the alerts tab. Attaching picture here. I'm not sure there is anything that needs to be changed on a dev/IT side. Hope this helps.

You can close the ticket. This isn't a support issue. Adding LeAnn. 

LeAnn please take this one, check email string. Organize a half hour call with JoAnn Capone and Add Jennifer Izzo and me, about the below Q&A. 

1) Transportation instructions text, from the sales order, are intended for BluJay-> Comments area of the order. These specific instructions have been typed in or defaulted so as to send to BluJay, AND / OR to also be printed on the BOL in special instructions. 

2) If they are requesting hard coding this comment on ALL BOLs:  

1) Is this only from Canadian locations to the US? 
2) Is it specifically just for the BOL? 
3) WE HAVE A MATERIAL SPECIFIC Organic/GMO material indicator that if checked I believe shows somewhere in the PACKING LIST. This may be sufficient. Not ALL of our materials are ORGANIC are they? Why would we hard code this comment on all BOLs?

Hi,

We also need to have Customer Service put in block requests through MDG Customer to block the ship-tos in sales org 2000.  That will allow the forecast to show up under 1100.  We need to have these requests put in before the refresh over the weekend.

Bethany  can you work on putting in these requests?  I believe Niki has a list of ship-tos that should be blocked in 2000.

Checking up on this email chain if we got the below info? The PO in this email chain for Wakefern came over to SAP as ED Smith Sales Org 2000 and you can see from their screen shot they wrote it to EDS. 
This order was created yesterday and is shipping after the new year so needs to be updated to BVF as the vendor.  
Joanne or Ed can you please request that?
 
Orders created today for Wakefern did pull 1100 BVF Sales Org.

Jon:
 
Do you have a list of ship-to/material combinations for this change?
 
I checked for example Wakerfern (31006), there are 30 some ship-tos for Wakerfern. But using Katherine's material list in her spreadsheet, maybe only one Wakerfern ship-to (202864) is in scope for this change.

What is the total scope of this issue?
 
At the beginning of this email, it was just speaking about Wakefern.  Now Wegmans is mentioned.
 
Is it that all Wakefern (Cust Hier 31006) and all Wegmans (Cust Hier 31018) items (in all product hierarchies) that were previously CA will now be US?
 
Or, is the change more granular than that?

Hello All,
 
There are 2 separate email chains going on, so I have combined the two to get everyone on the same page,  I didn't want to have duplicate efforts.

Imran/Maggie,
Can you help with this issue?
There was a sales org re-alignment that happened for Wakefern ship-tos. 
They are not showing up correctly in APO DP. 
 
Eddie,
Can you share specifics around ship-to and SKUs on these?
 
Thanks,
Vikram

Hello Imran

 

I believe Sid helped load the file to Production - (/ibpreference/prd/work/Warehouse_Manual_File.csv) the last time. For future reference, the excel file you sent has a worksheet named SHERRI2 which is saved as a .csv format (attached ). Once the file has been loaded in Production the existing Master Data Job will process the new file as intended.

 

@Basis can you please help drop the attached csv file in the Production folder path  - /ibpreference/prd/work/

Copying Sai as well, so he is also aware of this process.

 

 

Kind Regards

 

Vivienne
