Customer Delivery
Purpose 
The outbound delivery is the document in SAP used to perform the distribution to the customer. This process design document covers the outbound delivery created for distributing to the external customer.  
After the outbound delivery is created, it will be sent to the 3PL who manages the inventory on Otsuka’s behalf for distribution. The actual distribution to the external customer happens at the 3PL warehouse. So, the delivery documents created in SAP will be collectively sent to 3PL at frequent intervals during the day. Actual frequency will be decided later when the batch job is defined. 

There is a cutoff time for the 3PL to receive the order. But delivery document should be sent to 3PL regardless of the cutoff time. So that the expedited deliveries can be managed by 3PL without any additional manual tasks. 

After completing the shipment, 3PL sends the shipment confirmation interface to update the shipment information in the outbound delivery and perform the Post Goods Issue (PGI). 

Most of the times, 3PL will pick the batch as per the FEFO logic. In some cases, business needs to ship specific batch to the customer. In this situation, the outbound delivery carries the batch number to be shipped to the 3PL via interface.

Standard Invoice
Purpose  
The billing process starts when there is any sales order/Delivery document is due for billing. The billing document will be created with reference to delivery document after Post Good Issue (PGI) is completed. Invoice captures details from previous document such as pricing, customer partner functions (Sold to, Ship to, Payer, Bill to). Once all parameters are  verified and tax is calculated, it creates accounting document, which posts to Accounts Receivables and Revenue Accounts.  

The billing document can be created in the following ways:   
Processing a billing due list automatically as a background task for routine transactions (for example: every midnight)  
Processing the billing due list manually based on the selection criteria entered for documents to be processed (e.g. billing date, customer, etc.), the system displays a list of documents from which the user can select for billing creation  
Manually creating a billing document by explicitly specifying the delivery reference/sales order number  
 

Standard Invoice process contains the following components:  
Invoice creation from delivery  
Transferring billing data to Financial Accounting  
Cancel Billing transactions  

 

When the billing document is saved, the system automatically posts entries to the appropriate accounts. It does this by first determining the account assignment for each entry, using the company code chart of accounts, sales organization, customer account assignment group, material account assignment group, and order reason account key.   

Examples of the various account types that can be posted to are:  
Accounts receivable  
Revenue  
Sales deduction  
Accruals

Chargeback
Purpose 
Direct Customers purchase Pharma products from Otsuka at WAC price and sell them to some Indirect Customers at a different contracted price. Otsuka has contracts with these Indirect Customers. This contract information is shared with the 3PL and stored in the 3PL system based on input from Otsuka. When the Indirect Customer buys from the Otsuka Direct Customer at a contracted price, which is lower than the WAC price, the Direct Customer charges Otsuka for the difference in the form of Chargeback Credit. 

The Direct Customer sends the Chargeback request to the 3PL, the 3PL reviews the request, finalizes the Chargeback and sends the information to Otsuka through EDI 844 to create Chargeback Credit/Debit Memo Request. Since the incoming Chargeback Credit is already reviewed and finalized, the Chargeback Credit/Debit Memo Request is not set for Billing Block. The Chargeback Credit/Debit Memo Request is invoiced to create the Credit/Debit Invoice and financial document is posted.
